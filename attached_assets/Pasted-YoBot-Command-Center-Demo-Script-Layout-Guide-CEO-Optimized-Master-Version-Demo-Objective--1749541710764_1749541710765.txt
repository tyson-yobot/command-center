🎙️ ELEVENLABS VOICEOVER SCRIPT (FULL LENGTH)

[🎬 INTRO – TYSON ON SCREEN, FACING CAMERA]

Hey — I’m Tyson, founder of YoBot®. And if you’re watching this, I don’t need to sell you on AI. You already know it’s changing everything.

But here's the truth:
AI isn’t a trend. It’s an economic revolution — and businesses that ignore it? They're going extinct.

YoBot® exists to make sure that’s not you.

We’re not another SaaS company. We’re a full automation system — custom built to replace outdated CRMs, follow-up failures, missed sales, and bloated payroll.

We built YoBot® so you can finally scale without hiring. Without burnout. Without lag. Just a streamlined, automated system that works 24/7 — and delivers results.

Let’s take a look.

[🎥 CUT TO TYSON ON SCREEN – SALES CLOSE SECTION]

So what does YoBot® really do?

It eliminates waste.
It replaces salaries.
It builds pipelines.
It turns SOPs into automated flows.
And it helps you scale without the chaos.

Let’s talk dollars:

Sales commission? Gone — that's $200K/year back in your pocket.

No 401K match, PTO, sick pay, maternity leave, flights, meals, bonuses, or burnout.

📈 One of our clients increased revenue by 74% in 45 days.
Lead cost dropped by 37%.
Manual hours? Cut from 200/week to under 10.

[💬 TYSON – HEART-TO-HEART CLOSE]

Here’s the bottom line:
Most companies are still running like it’s 2010. Big teams. Bigger payroll. Endless software subscriptions. And too much time wasted on things that should’ve been automated years ago.

You’ve got salaries... commissions... benefits...
✈️ Travel expenses, 💼 laptops, 📞 phones, 🚗 mileage, 🍽️ meals, ⏱️ time off. The list goes on.

With YoBot®, all of that? Gone.

This isn’t about replacing people. It’s about replacing inefficiency. It's about building something that works as hard as you do — even when you're not working.

You don’t need a 10-person sales team.
You need one system that does it all — accurately, automatically, and affordably.

The businesses that win the next 5 years are the ones that automate now.
If you're watching this... you already know you're ready.
