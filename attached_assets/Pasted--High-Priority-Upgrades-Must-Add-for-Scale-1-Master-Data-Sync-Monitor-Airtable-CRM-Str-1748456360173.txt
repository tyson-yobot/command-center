🚨 High-Priority Upgrades (Must-Add for Scale)
1. 🗂️ Master Data Sync Monitor (Airtable + CRM + Stripe + QB)
Add: A widget showing last successful sync timestamps and error states for:

Airtable

HubSpot

Stripe

QuickBooks

🧠 Why: As you're syncing across 5+ platforms, this ensures data reliability without manual checks.

2. 📦 Active Clients / Bot Instances Monitor
Add: A box showing:

Total Bots Live

Active Projects (like AMT66)

% with full automation enabled

Flag bots missing core integrations (e.g., Voice → CRM not yet wired)

💡 Why: Makes it obvious what clients are not fully activated — great for internal audits and upsell ops.

3. 📊 System-Wide Audit Log / Change Tracker
Add: Bottom footer module logging:

“Mike updated VoiceBot config”

“Webhook delay >2s triggered alert”

“Stripe sync failed – fallback engaged”

👁 Why: Tracks system drift + debugging without digging into Make or Airtable.

4. ⚙️ Quick Access Dev Tools / Admin Tools Panel
Add:

Restart Workflow

Toggle Voice ID fallback

Clear Cache

Export Logs

Inject Test Lead

🚀 Why: Give your ops team (you + Daniel) faster control over Make scenarios and training pipelines.

🔁 Mid-Priority Tweaks
5. 📈 Conversion Funnel Widget
Add: A mini funnel:

Calls → Leads → Meetings → Closed

CTR % and dropoff per stage

🔍 Why: Helps you optimize the sales engine without jumping into Airtable.

6. 📤 VoiceBot Metrics: Fallback Audio Count + Language Variants
Add: Show how often fallback Voice ID was used and how many Tone Variants were triggered this week.

🗣️ Why: Proves the Tone Response system is working and helps scale voice personas over time.

7. 💬 Internal Chat Module (Optional but Smart)
Add: Slack-style collapsible chat for dev team (Daniel, you, ops) — pull Slack threads in via webhook.

🤖 Why: Lets you see convo threads about error logs or roadmap items inside the Command Center.

💡 Visual/UI Suggestions
Add Toggle Themes (Dark/Light Mode switch — especially useful for client portal access in future).

Add User Role Icon Top Right (Tyson / Daniel / Demo User with role-based toggles).

Make Error Queue Sticky (when >0 errors, stick it to top nav in red).
