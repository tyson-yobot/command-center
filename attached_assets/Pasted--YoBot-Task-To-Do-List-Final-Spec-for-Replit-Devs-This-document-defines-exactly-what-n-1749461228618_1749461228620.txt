### ✅ Integration QA Status Tracker — DO NOT MARK COMPLETE UNTIL TESTED & LOGGED

| Integration Name                | Module Type | Status    | Notes / Debug                                 | Scenario Link                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slack → Client Alert            | Slack       | ⏳ Pending | Needs retry block and dynamic message support | [https://replit.dev/scenario/slack-alert-qaflow](https://replit.dev/scenario/slack-alert-qaflow)   |
| Airtable → Sales Order Sync     | Airtable    | ✅ Pass    | Live sync and test data logs verified         | [https://replit.dev/scenario/airtable-sync-sales](https://replit.dev/scenario/airtable-sync-sales) |

| Stripe → One-Time Payment Log   | Stripe      | ❌ Fail    | Button triggered but no log created           | [https://replit.dev/scenario/stripe-onetime](https://replit.dev/scenario/stripe-onetime)           |

> 🧠 Once each item passes testing and is successfully logged to the Airtable QA Log, update the **Status** column and confirm link.

### 🗂️ Required Screen Structure & Naming — URGENT CLEANUP

⚠️ Replit has created 4+ duplicate Command Centers and several unnamed screens. This is causing complete disconnection and dev confusion. This must be resolved immediately.

#### ✅ Only These Screens Should Exist:

* **Main Command Center (Primary Dashboard)** → `/command-center`
* **Lead Scraper Configuration Tool** → `/lead-scraper`
* **Feature Toggle Panel (Control Panel)** → `/control-center`
* **Mobile Optimized Panel** → `/mobile`

#### 📱 Mobile vs. Desktop Clarification — DO NOT CROSS WIRE

* `/command-center` is the **full desktop interface** for live automation management, analytics, sales orders, and voice commands.
* `/mobile` is a **lightweight mobile dashboard** with mobile-only tools such as:

  * 📇 **Business Card Scanner**
  * 📱 One-touch communication shortcuts
  * 🎤 Mobile voice commands (limited)

> ❗ The Business Card Scanner belongs on `/mobile` — not `/command-center`. Connecting it to the desktop interface is incorrect and will break routing.

#### 🛠️ Dev Task List for Fixing This:

1. **Open Every Live Page You’ve Built** → One-by-one. Screens must be previewed or linked.
2. **Show Tyson Each Screen** → He will confirm if it’s legitimate or deprecated.
3. **Rename Approved Screens ONLY** using the routes above. All others:

   * Move to `/zzz-deprecated-do-not-use/`
   * Archive from active build workspace

#### 🚨 Why This Is Critical:

* Disconnections are spread across **the wrong pages**
* Dev is working on **multiple Command Center clones** at once
* Client has no way to verify which version is "live"

> ✅ Summary: There must be one Command Center, one Control Panel, one Lead Scraper, one Mobile Dashboard. Everything else must be deleted or archived immediately.

### 🧪 Airtable Test Logging – QA Sync Requirements

Every function, automation, and integration **must now log its QA test results into Airtable** using the official **Integration Test Log** table shown in the screenshot.

#### ✅ Airtable Info (Confirmed Active)

* **Base ID**: `appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if`
* **Table ID**: `tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU`
* **API Key**: `paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa`

#### ✅ Replit-Side Test Logging Script (Use After Every Function Test)

```js
await fetch("https://api.airtable.com/v0/appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if/tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    records: [
      {
        fields: {
          "Integration Name": "Slack → Client Alert",
          "✅ Pass/Fail": "✅ Pass",
          "🛠 Notes / Debug": "Slack triggered but Airtable logging failed on first attempt. Resolved.",
          "📅 Test Date": new Date().toISOString(),
          "🧑‍💻 QA Owner": "Daniel Sharpe",
          "📤 Output Data Populated?": true,
          "🧾 Record Created?": true,
          "🔁 Retry Attempted?": false,
          "🧩 Module Type": "Slack",
          "📂 Related Scenario Link": "https://replit.dev/scenario/slack-alert-qaflow"
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

> 🔁 **This script must be called after every individual module or function test**.
> No feature is considered completed unless it is confirmed live and logged in this Airtable table.

### 🛡️ Next Phase After Launch — Post-Wire Automations (add next):

* Slack alerts for failed QA status or errors (critical if something breaks silently)
* Auto-escalation to Critical Alert banner if 3+ failures are detected in any 15-min window
* System Health Audit module that logs and summarizes uptime and failures
* Weekly System Digest: Sends a summary email or Slack digest with test results, automation totals, usage logs
* Auto-disable broken buttons via failure detection script
* Completion log sent to 📊 Command Center · Metrics Tracker
* Connect all Support Tools (Zendesk ticket sync, FAQ retrieval, live chat RAG, ticket routing AI)

Final confirmation requires clean toggling between test/live with NO test contamination.
Make sure toggle switch disables logs
