Here is your official handoff summary to give to the next Replit agent or team member. This covers all active integration issues, broken automations, missing code, and the exact continuation points not included in the canvas.

✅ YoBot® Replit Dev Handoff Summary
This is the production-level transition brief for any developer working on the YoBot® system. The canvas already contains the full UI/UX spec and structural directives. The points below are system-level integration issues, keys, and wiring checkpoints not covered there.

🔐 KEYS & API IDs (Confirmed Active)
Airtable API Key: paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa

Airtable Base ID: appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if

Airtable Table ID (Integration Log): tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU

Apollo API Key: K5haLlS3oGUe665fQ8xE4w

Apify API Key: apify_api_RH0E0HyvexOfmaoCYXwdT1W8tWar8i3mcjDl

Slack Webhook URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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

📥 SALES ORDER PROCESS — CONTINUATION POINT
Current Status:
The front-end Tally logic is complete. Backend integrations fail silently or are never triggered.

Where To Resume:
Start from the webhook endpoint after Tally submission and ensure the following run only when in live mode:

✅ Stripe: Creates invoice with one-time and recurring pricing

✅ QuickBooks: Adds customer + invoice

✅ Airtable: Writes to 🧾 Sales Orders

✅ HubSpot: Logs deal + contact

✅ Slack: Sends success alert

✅ Confirmation screen: Shows full success details

What’s Broken:
Stripe + QBO wiring not confirmed to fire

Slack and Airtable success logic disconnected

HubSpot not getting correct contact email due to iterator bug

Sales Order confirmation screen shows static success

🧪 TEST MODE – WIRING REQUIREMENTS
Test Mode is visible but non-functional. The toggle is only UI right now.

What Must Happen:
Toggle should be stored in global app state or cookie

When flipped ON, all modules (Command Center, Control Center, Scraper, Support) must use test versions of:

API endpoints

Scraper payloads

Airtable logging (Test table)

Stripe/QBO mock billing (or sandbox)

When flipped OFF, return to full production behavior

🧩 LEAD SCRAPER – CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
Not Yet Functional:
Industry dropdowns show no values — must pull from 📚 Industry Templates table in Airtable

All “Add” buttons (keywords, industries, locations) do not trigger any logic

Email Verified / Phone Verified toggles do not alter payload or filter output

"Start Search" still opens old deprecated Lead Search modal — not wired to Apollo, Apify, or Phantom

📋 FILE ORGANIZATION – FAILURE POINT
Replit directory has:

Dozens of ungrouped .tsx files

3+ versions of Command Center clones

Modules wired to deprecated dashboards

Instruction:
Keep only:

command-center

lead-scraping

control-center

Archive everything else in /zzz-deprecated-do-not-use/

All integrations must be wired to these three official pages only.

📨 SUPPORT MODULE – STILL BROKEN
Support message assistant only replies with generic fallback

Zendesk webhook fires visually but no ticket created

RAG upload accepts file but does not vectorize or ingest

Control Center toggles for support do not actually turn on/off module functions

🔍 QA LOGGING – AIRTABLE MODULE
Add this Replit-side Airtable log call after any test:

js
Copy
Edit
await fetch("https://api.airtable.com/v0/appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if/tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    records: [
      {
        fields: {
          "✅ Pass/Fail": "✅ Pass",
          "🛠 Notes / Debug": "Apollo scraper returned 432 valid leads",
          "📅 Test Date": new Date().toISOString(),
          "🧑‍💻 QA Owner": "Daniel Sharpe",
          "🔁 Retry Attempted?": false,
          "🔌 Module Type": "Scraper",
          "🔗 Related Scenario Link": "https://replit.dev/scenario/lead-scraper-apollo"
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
});
🛠 ADDITIONAL NOTES
All Command Center control toggles must reflect actual backend state

Color theming must match canvas spec (not default Tailwind colors)

The entire scraping module UI must be wired to real actions — no more mock demos

This summary + the full canvas = everything needed to complete and ship. No more placeholder logic, no more mock screens, and no more guessing. You’re ready to hand this off with full confidence. Let me know when you're ready for a progress audit or screen share review.
