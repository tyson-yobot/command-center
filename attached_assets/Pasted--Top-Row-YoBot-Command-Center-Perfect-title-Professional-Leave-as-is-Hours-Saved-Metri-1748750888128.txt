🔷 Top Row
✅ YoBot® Command Center
Perfect title. Professional. Leave as is.

⚠️ Hours Saved
✅ Metric makes sense

💡 Rename suggestion:
From: Hours Saved
To: ⏱️ Manual Hours Avoided (sounds more like automation payoff)

✅ Revenue Captured
Reads clearly and logically. No change needed.

⚠️ Active Conversations
Metric: 47 + 10 high-priority leads = good

💡 Add a subtitle for clarity:
Current Open Conversations (or “Live Bot Threads”)

⚠️ Pipeline Value
Suggest:
From: Pipeline Value
To: 🎯 Projected Deal Volume
(Pipeline can sound vague without context — “deal volume” = sales clarity)

🟦 Midsection Cards
✅ 🧠 Bot Health Monitor
All labels are aligned

✅ Uptime Status is helpful

💡 Optional: Rename “Current Errors” → Live Error Events for clarity

✅ 📈 Revenue Forecast
MRR, 30d Projection, Confidence all align with heading
No change needed.

NPS + Churn Risk Flags = good

Add clarity to heading:

All metrics make sense. No change needed.

📉 Workflow + Insights
✅ ⚙️ Workflow Performance
Tasks, success rate, and automation queue make sense.

💡 Optional: Change Next Automation → Next Triggered Workflow

⚠️ 📊 Botalytics™
This is where you called it out — you’re right:

Cost Per Lead, Quality Score, Close Rate = classic Botalytics KPIs

✅ Fix:

Title should be: 📊 Botalytics™ Metrics

⚠️ 📈 SmartSpend™
ROI, Budget, CPL Trend, Time to ROI = all good

✅ “Monthly Savings vs Manual” is a clear automation ROI metric

✅ Fix:

Title should be: 📈 SmartSpend™ Analytics

💡 Deeper System Panels
⚠️ 🧠 AI Assistant Insights
These are training, learning, injection metrics — not general "insights"

✅ Rename to:
AI Assistant Performance or AI Behavior Stats

✅ 🛠 System Status (Read-Only)
Everything here is clear. “Last Maintenance” is a great trust signal.

💡 Optional: “System Health” → Infra Health Score

🎉 Bottom Panels
✅ 🎉 Hours Saved (Green Bar)
Perfect celebratory UX and motivational stat.

✅ 🗣️ Voice Commands
Perfect — reads like a quick-access bot interface.

💡 Optional: add toggle to “Edit Voice Snippets” or “Train New Commands”

Sentiment, Resolution, Intent — clean

"Top Intent: Product Demo Request" = gold

💡 Optional: Add “Last Updated” timestamp for data freshness tracking

🧾 Final Cosmetic Polish
UI Element	Suggestion
Blue buttons top right (Voice Command, etc.)	Slight glow or icon touch to match visual hierarchy
Section Spacing	Add thin dividers or background fades between rows for quick visual chunking
Tooltip Layer	Add hover-tooltips on every metric title for explanation (especially for clients)

✅ Final Renamed Block List Summary
Old Name	New Name
Botalytics™	📊 Botalytics™ Metrics
SmartSpend™	📈 SmartSpend™ Analytics
AI Assistant Insights	🧠 AI Assistant Performance
Client Pulse	🫀 Client Satisfaction Overview
Pipeline Value	🎯 Projected Deal Volume
Hours Saved	⏱️ Manual Hours Avoided (optional)

Let me know if you want a fully updated Figma label map, or I can drop this into your dev spec or Help Guide voice script. You're basically done — just needs a label cleanup to match the gold-standard system you’ve built.






You said:
ROI is more of a botalytic wouldnt you say?


ChatGPT said:
✅ 100% — yes, ROI belongs under Botalytics™, not SmartSpend™. You're absolutely right to challenge that.

Here’s the clean breakdown:

🔍 What Botalytics™ Should Own
Botalytics™ is your AI performance and business impact module. It should capture revenue, leads, and financial efficiency — including:

✅ Revenue Per Lead

✅ Lead Quality Score

✅ Close Rate

✅ Cost Per Lead

✅ ROI (Return on Investment) ← This belongs here

✅ Sentiment-to-Sale Tracking (if added later)

✅ Churn Reduction Impact (client stickiness)

💬 Why?
Because ROI is a performance yield metric, not an ad-spend metric. It reflects what your bot or system produced in return for what was spent — not how it was budgeted. That’s what SmartSpend™ is for.

🔍 What SmartSpend™ Should Own
SmartSpend™ is your spending efficiency & automation savings engine. It should cover:

✅ Ad Spend ROI (if it's marketing-specific only)

✅ Budget Utilization

✅ Cost Per Lead Trend (ad-focused)

✅ Time to ROI

✅ Hours Saved vs Manual

✅ Manual Process Avoidance Savings

💬 Why?
This is about efficiency vs effort — how much automation is reducing overhead cost, time, and spend across systems.

🧠 Final Fix
Move this line:

ROI: 324%
FROM SmartSpend™
TO Botalytics™ (as "ROI: 324%")

And clarify SmartSpend’s stat:

Monthly Savings vs Manual: $12,840
✅ This belongs under SmartSpend™

💡 BONUS: Rename SmartSpend™ Metric
Change ROI: 324% →
→ Manual Process ROI (if you want to keep a version in SmartSpend™)
But the main ROI belongs in Botalytics™.
