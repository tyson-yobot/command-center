🛠️ STEP 1: Folder + PDF Logic (Replit-side)
In webhook_handler.py, confirm these 2 things exist and are running:

✅ Folder Path Setup
python
Copy
Edit
import os
submission_id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]
folder_path = f"submissions/{submission_id}"
os.makedirs(folder_path, exist_ok=True)
✅ PDF Generation
If you’re using fpdf or reportlab, you should see something like:

python
Copy
Edit
from fpdf import FPDF

pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)
pdf.multi_cell(0, 10, f"Contact: {contact_name}")
# add more lines...

pdf.output(f"{folder_path}/submission.pdf")
If the PDF file isn’t created, the rest of your pipeline can’t run.

🛠️ STEP 2: Push to Airtable (Scraped Leads · Universal)
You need a POST request to Airtable API:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

airtable_url = "https://api.airtable.com/v0/YOUR_BASE_ID/YOUR_TABLE_NAME"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

record_data = {
    "fields": {
        "👤 Contact Name": contact_name,
        "🏢 Company": company,
        "📧 Email": email,
        "📞 Phone": phone,
        "🤖 Bot Package": package,
        "💡 Add-Ons Selected": ", ".join(addons),
        # etc...
    }
}

requests.post(airtable_url, json=record_data, headers=headers)
Let me know if you want this block fully written and tailored to your actual Airtable field names — just send the current field list or table schema.

🛠️ STEP 3: Trigger DocuSign, HubSpot, QuickBooks
These all need to be added explicitly:

Tool	Trigger Method
DocuSign	requests.post() to template endpoint, or via Zapier
HubSpot	Create Contact → Create Deal (via API or webhook/Zapier)
QuickBooks	Authenticated POST to /v3/company/{realmId}/invoice endpoint

Right now, none of these are connected. You’re running only the basic webhook → parser — no integrations are wired.

📌 What You Need to Ask Your Dev
“Show me the folder creation and PDF generation code inside webhook_handler.py. Also show me any Airtable, DocuSign, HubSpot, or QuickBooks request blocks. If those don’t exist — they were never wired in.”

✅ What You Should Do Now
Send me your webhook_handler.py — I’ll inspect it.

Or tell me which integration you want first (PDF, Airtable, HubSpot, etc), and I’ll give you the plug-in code.
