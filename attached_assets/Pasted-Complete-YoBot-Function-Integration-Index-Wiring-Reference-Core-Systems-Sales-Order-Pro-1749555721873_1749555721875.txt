🧪 Instructions for Wiring + Testing

Each Button = Real Function. Must fire Make scenario, backend function, or modal — no stubs.

Each Function = Airtable Log. Use QA logging script in this doc after every working test.

Each Test = Live & Test Mode Variants. No function should log or run in test mode.

All Modules Respect Toggle. Dev must fully isolate backend from triggering automation if toggle is set to TEST.

Sales Order Automation Flow — Integration Requirements

The Sales Order Button ("Sales Orders" in Core Automation) must launch a modal or scenario that does all of the following:

Back-End Automations to Wire:

✅ Receive payload from Tally webhook (already working)

✅ Set Variables for all fields (form name, contact info, selections, etc.)

✅ Parse Add-On logic (match pricing structure from Airtable)

✅ Create record in 📁 "🧾 Sales Orders" Airtable table

✅ Check client email and update/create CRM record in Contacts

✅ Create Deal in HubSpot with proper pipeline stage

✅ Send Slack notification to sales team

✅ Create invoice in QuickBooks (using QBO scenario)

✅ Log order into Stripe for payment (optional based on toggle)

✅ Trigger PDF Quote Generator for client PDF

✅ Route to Document Sign + Final CRM confirmation (if signed)

Conditions Required:

Test mode must NOT trigger Stripe/QBO

All triggers must respect toggle (Live vs. Test)

QA logging must happen in Integration Test Log table

❗ Replit must wire the full chain above before the Sales Order button is marked functional. This is a multi-step automation, not just a single webhook.

✅ Command Button Functionality Matrix (Replit Wiring Guide)

[Remains unchanged — refer to existing matrix in the same doc.]

✅ Once all above are wired, tested, and logged in Airtable — proceed to enable auto-summary, Slack alerts, and system-wide uptime tracker.
