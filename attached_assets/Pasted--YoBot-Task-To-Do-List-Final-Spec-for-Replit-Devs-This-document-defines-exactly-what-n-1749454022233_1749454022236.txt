🧠 **YoBot® Task To Do List — Final Spec for Replit Devs**

This document defines **exactly what needs to be done** for each lead scraper module (Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster) and all additional Command Center systems to ensure full functionality, perfect UX, cross-platform compatibility, and sales order automation — with scalability for global deployment.

---

### 🗂️ Required Screen Structure & Naming — URGENT CLEANUP

⚠️ Replit has created 4+ duplicate Command Centers and several unnamed screens. This is causing complete disconnection and dev confusion. This must be resolved immediately.

#### ✅ Only These Screens Should Exist:

* **Main Command Center (Primary Dashboard)** → `/command-center`
* **Lead Scraper Configuration Tool** → `/lead-scraper`
* **Feature Toggle Panel (Control Panel)** → `/control-center`
* **Mobile Optimized Panel** → `/mobile`

#### 📱 Mobile vs. Desktop Clarification — DO NOT CROSS WIRE

* `/command-center` is the **full desktop interface** for live automation management, analytics, sales orders, and voice commands.
* `/mobile` is a **lightweight mobile dashboard** with mobile-only tools such as:

  * 📇 **Business Card Scanner**
  * 📱 One-touch communication shortcuts
  * 🎤 Mobile voice commands (limited)

> ❗ The Business Card Scanner belongs on `/mobile` — not `/command-center`. Connecting it to the desktop interface is incorrect and will break routing.

#### 🛠️ Dev Task List for Fixing This:

1. **Open Every Live Page You’ve Built** → One-by-one. Screens must be previewed or linked.
2. **Show Tyson Each Screen** → He will confirm if it’s legitimate or deprecated.
3. **Rename Approved Screens ONLY** using the routes above. All others:

   * Move to `/zzz-deprecated-do-not-use/`
   * Archive from active build workspace

#### 🚨 Why This Is Critical:

* Disconnections are spread across **the wrong pages**
* Dev is working on **multiple Command Center clones** at once
* Client has no way to verify which version is "live"

> ✅ Summary: There must be one Command Center, one Control Panel, one Lead Scraper, one Mobile Dashboard. Everything else must be deleted or archived immediately.

### 🧪 Airtable Test Logging – QA Sync Requirements

Every function, automation, and integration **must now log its QA test results into Airtable** using the official **Integration Test Log** table shown in the screenshot.

#### ✅ Airtable Info (Confirmed Active)

* **Base ID**: `appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if`
* **Table ID**: `tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU`
* **API Key**: `paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa`

#### ✅ Replit-Side Test Logging Script (Use After Every Function Test)

```js
await fetch("https://api.airtable.com/v0/appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if/tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    records: [
      {
        fields: {
          "Integration Name": "Slack → Client Alert",
          "✅ Pass/Fail": "✅ Pass",
          "🛠 Notes / Debug": "Slack triggered but Airtable logging failed on first attempt. Resolved.",
          "📅 Test Date": new Date().toISOString(),
          "🧑‍💻 QA Owner": "Daniel Sharpe",
          "📤 Output Data Populated?": true,
          "🧾 Record Created?": true,
          "🔁 Retry Attempted?": false,
          "🧩 Module Type": "Slack",
          "📂 Related Scenario Link": "https://replit.dev/scenario/slack-alert-qaflow"
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

> 🔁 **This script must be called after every individual module or function test**.
> No feature is considered completed unless it is confirmed live and logged in this Airtable table.

#### 🔧 What You Need to Do Now

1. Go back and hook up **every single function, feature, and automation** to `replit.dev/command-center` only.
2. Remove all outdated, duplicate, or unused references from alternate dashboards
3. As you reconnect each function, test it **one by one** and then use the script above to log it to Airtable.
4. Ensure fields match exactly with: ✅ Pass/Fail, QA Owner, Module Type, Debug Notes, Scenario Link

✅ This is how we restore structure and prevent these issues from recurring.

### 🚫 Test Mode Isolation – PRODUCTION LOCKDOWN REQUIREMENTS

Effective immediately — all test data, test automation, or test logic must remain fully isolated from production mode.

#### ✅ Your App Must Support This Behavior:

| Mode          | Behavior                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live Mode** | Writes to production databases (Airtable, Stripe, QBO, HubSpot). Logs real contacts, sales orders, automations. No dummy data allowed. |
| **Test Mode** | Uses sandbox/test keys, mock payloads, and test Airtable QA table if available. All UI should display a visible "🧪 Test Mode" status. |

#### 🔧 How to Implement

* Declare a global systemMode state (e.g. `"test" | "live"`)
* Set default to `"live"`, toggle via Control Panel UI
* Surround all automation triggers and data writes with a mode check:

```ts
if (systemMode === 'live') {
  triggerStripeInvoice();
  createQuickBooksRecord();
  postToAirtableProd();
} else {
  useSandboxFlow();
  logToAirtableTestTable();
}
```

#### 🚫 What Is NOT Allowed

* No test records in production Airtable
* No sandbox transactions hitting real Stripe/QuickBooks keys
* No test buttons wired to live `/command-center`

> ⚠️ Any module that does not follow this rule must be disabled until properly split.
