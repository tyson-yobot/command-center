🧠 **YoBot® Task To Do List — Final Spec for Replit Devs**

This document defines **exactly what needs to be done** for each lead scraper module (Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster) and all additional Command Center systems to ensure full functionality, perfect UX, cross-platform compatibility, and sales order automation — with scalability for global deployment.

---

### ✅ Universal Requirements (Apply to All Tools)

* Group filters into logical sections
* Use consistent layout (2-column grid with left/right balance)
* All dropdowns must support default value + full label names
* Every input field should have a label and an optional tooltip ("?")
* Filters should be grouped into sections:

  * 🧑 Contact Filters
  * 🏢 Company/Business Filters
  * ⚙️ Scraping Settings / Execution Settings
* Include bottom bar with:

  * 🔄 Filter summary (e.g. “7 filters applied”)
  * ⏱ Estimated leads/profiles/listings (dynamic)
  * 💾 Save preset button
  * 🚀 Launch button (sticky footer on scroll)
* Toggle between Test Company Mode (fake data, instant) vs YoBot Live Mode (real scraper and live data)
* Color scheme must match the YoBot® Command Center:

  * Apollo: Blue accent (💙)
  * Apify: Green accent (💚)
  * PhantomBuster: Purple accent (💜)
  * Base theme must always be dark navy/gradient, not harsh black
* ✅ Ensure all buttons work (especially all "Add" buttons, dropdowns, and toggles)
* ✅ Replace “Twitter” references with “X (formerly Twitter)”
* ✅ Update PhantomBuster dropdown to say: Platform → LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter)
* ✅ "Use API" option should say: Use YoBot Dashboard instead
* ✅ Email Verified / Phone Verified toggles should default to checked and reflect real verification before sending to HubSpot
* 🚨 All industry dropdowns must dynamically populate from Airtable 📚 Industry Templates table
* 🚨 Test Mode toggle must affect backend response mode — no fake data without toggle ON

### 📣 Command Center Expansion: Immediate Action Items

**None of the current buttons in Command Center work or trigger real functions.** The following must be added, fixed, or replaced with real logic and integration.

#### 🆕 MUST ADD TO COMMAND CENTER:

**1. Social Media Content Creator**
→ New button in `Data & Reports` column labeled `📢 Content Creator`
→ Clicking opens side drawer or modal with:

* Content type selector (Post / Reel / Ad / Email)
* Platform selector (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)
* Voice and tone dropdown (Professional, Funny, Aggressive, Value-Driven)
* Monthly content calendar view
* Auto-generate and export options (PDF, .txt, Airtable push)
* Slack push for daily post
* Save to Airtable `📣 Social Scripts Log`

**2. Mailchimp Integration Manager**
→ New section in `Data & Reports` column labeled `📧 Mailchimp Sync`
→ Controls:

* Audience List dropdown (fetched from Mailchimp)
* Send Campaign / Draft Campaign / Preview
* Connect to latest offer or client funnel via dropdown
* Export lead segment from CRM based on tag
* Track open/click rate to Airtable `📬 Campaign Metrics Log`

### 🔧 UX/Interface FIXES NEEDED FROM SCREENSHOTS

* `Voice Programming Interface` fails to upload files → **RAG uploader not connected to vector DB**
* `Voice Generation` works visually but not functionally → **ElevenLabs endpoint not triggered**
* `Start/Stop Calls`, `Run Load Scrape`, `Submit Ticket`, and all buttons at top **currently do nothing** → Must be wired to backend automations
* `System Mode Toggle` must trigger test/live state in global React context or cookie with API side effects
* All red dots (❗) and system errors shown in widgets must be clickable to view logs or drill-down

* Airtable Base ID: `appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if`
