We’re ready to begin development on the YoBotAssistant mobile app and wanted to provide key details to help you get started efficiently.

🚀 About Us
YoBot® is a fully automated AI business system designed for companies that want to scale without hiring more staff. We provide AI-powered bots (chat + voice) bundled with CRM, quoting, booking, compliance, and full backend automation through Airtable, Make.com, and QuickBooks.

Our clients range from startups to enterprise resellers, and everything is built for speed, automation, and real ROI.

🎯 App Purpose
We want to build a Progressive Web App (PWA) that serves as a real-time control panel and monitoring tool for users of our bot system.

This app will act as a mobile version of our Command Center Dashboard — giving admins access to bot data, analytics, lead alerts, call logs, CRM syncs, and key settings.

✅ Initial Version (MVP Scope)
The first version should include:

📊 Real-Time Bot Performance Stats (calls, convos, conversions, lead volume, etc.)

🧠 Conversation Log Viewer

🎯 Live Notifications (triggered events like leads captured or missed calls)

🗂️ Basic Client CRM Info View

🕹️ Control Toggles (e.g. pause bot, reroute leads, change tone settings)

🔍 Search Bar to lookup past conversations or leads

This will be a browser-based mobile-first PWA, using WebSockets or polling for real-time updates.

🔜 Future Phases (to stage for later)
Please build with these in mind for phase 2+:

🔄 Native mobile app (React Native) with push notifications (Firebase)

🔗 Real API integration to Airtable, HubSpot, and QuickBooks

⚙️ Role-based access for client users and agency partners

🎨 White-label theming and branding

📈 Advanced analytics and forecasting dashboard

📁 Reference Systems (Already Built)
CRM is in Airtable

Automations via Make.com

QuickBooks sync already live

All bot logs and triggers are written to Airtable tables (we can share schemas)

Let me know if you need mockups, database structure, or API keys to get started. Looking forward to getting this rolling.
