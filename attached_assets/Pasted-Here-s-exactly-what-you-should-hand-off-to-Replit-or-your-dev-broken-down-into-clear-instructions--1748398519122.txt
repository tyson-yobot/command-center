Here’s exactly what you should hand off to Replit or your dev — broken down into clear instructions and two phases: Must-Have (Card Scanner) and Optional Tools to Future-Proof YoBot.

✅ PHASE 1 — MUST-HAVE: Business Card Scanner → CRM Integration
🎯 Objective:
Let users scan a physical business card from their phone, and have the contact auto-populated into the 📇 CRM Contacts table in Airtable — with full Make automation behind it.

👨‍💻 Instructions for Replit Dev:
1. Install OCR Library (if building in-house):
Use:

tesseract.js (Node.js OCR wrapper)

or connect to Google Cloud Vision API or Microsoft Azure OCR

📌 Preferred: Build this as a mobile web module in your Command Center or a mini PWA, using phone camera input.

2. Build “Scan Card” UI Module:
Use mobile camera input (HTML5 <input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">)

Add "Scan Business Card" button under CRM or Bot Controls

After capture → preview image → user confirms → parse to text

3. Extract Key Fields from OCR Response:
Full Name

Company

Title

Phone Number

Email

Website (if detected)

Use regex or string classification to identify field types.

4. Send Parsed Data to Make Webhook:
Send payload to:

arduino

Edit
https://hook.make.com/[your-yobot-webhook-endpoint]
Payload structure:

json
Copy

{
  "source": "card_scan",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "company": "TechCorp",
  "title": "Director of IT",
  "email": "john.doe@techcorp.com",
  "phone": "+1 (555) 123-4567",
  "website": "www.techcorp.com"
}
5. Optional: Add Tag “Scanned via Business Card” in CRM
This will let you filter which leads came from in-person events.

🧠 PHASE 2 — Optional Tools to Future-Proof YoBot
Here are tools to consider installing into the Command Center right now or shortly after launch:

Tool	What It Does	Why Add It
🗓️ Calendar Sync	Syncs calls/meetings with Google/Outlook	Auto-adds demo appointments
🧠 Lead Enrichment (Clearbit/Apollo)	Auto-fills company size, industry, revenue	Saves sales rep research time
🧾 PDF Card Export	Download scanned cards as PDFs	Backup for offline storage
🗂️ Batch Card Import	Drag/drop 5+ cards from events	Speeds up lead intake post-conference
📞 VoiceBot Callback Toggle	“Auto-call scanned lead tomorrow”	Lets bot follow up proactively
📍 Geolocation Stamp	Tags location of scan (event badge, expo, etc.)	Source attribution for ROI tracking

🚀 Final Deliverable to Replit:
Tell them:

"We need a lightweight business card scanner integrated into our YoBot Command Center mobile dashboard. It must OCR the card, extract contact info, and post it to our Make webhook as a structured JSON payload. Build with mobile-first UX. Add fallback error handling and a 'Review/Edit' screen before submission. If possible, include field detection and enrichment modules.”
