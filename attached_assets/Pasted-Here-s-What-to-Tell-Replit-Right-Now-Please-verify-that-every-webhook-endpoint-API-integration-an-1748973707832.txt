Here's What to Tell Replit Right Now
"Please verify that every webhook endpoint, API integration, and automation workflow is fully wired, testable, and returning successful responses across the entire YoBot system. Run a full QA pass on the following:"

🔍 ✅ 1. Webhook Integration Test Checklist
Ask them to manually test each of these endpoints with sample data (Postman or curl) and confirm 200 OK with correct downstream automation:

Webhook Endpoint	Purpose	Confirm
/api/webhook/lead	Lead scoring, CRM sync, Slack	✅
/api/webhook/support	GPT reply + voice + fallback logging	✅
/api/webhook/payment	QuickBooks invoice + Airtable log	✅
/api/webhook/stripe	Subscriptions, billing alerts	✅
/api/webhook/hubspot	CRM updates, workflows	✅
/api/webhook/usage	Plan thresholds, upgrade alerts	✅
/api/webhook/calendar	Auto reminders + Slack follow-up	✅
/api/webhook/form	Tally form sync	✅
/api/qbo/auth	QBO OAuth flow redirect	✅

🔗 ✅ 2. Integration Keys + Live Tests
“Confirm each of the following integrations is fully authenticated and has run at least one successful test using live or sandbox data.”

Integration	Test	Status
✅ Slack Bot	Sent voice/audio & support reply	
✅ Airtable	Record created in fallback/log table	
✅ ElevenLabs	MP3 generated and uploaded	
✅ OpenAI	GPT support reply + fallback trigger	
✅ QuickBooks	OAuth success + invoice created	
✅ Stripe	Webhook triggered and responded	
✅ HubSpot	Contact + pipeline sync tested	

📋 ✅ 3. Log Tables Setup
Have them verify that records are being written to:

📩 Support Ticket Log

🧾 Payment Tracker

🧠 AI Response Log

🧯 Error + Fallback Log

🧪 QA Event Results (if created)

📊 Usage Alerts Log (if usage tracking is on)

🧪 ✅ 4. QA Command
Ask them to confirm:

"Run a full automated test suite simulating:

1 support ticket

1 lead capture

1 payment event

1 QBO invoice

1 failed voice fallback (for error logging)

…and show screenshots or console logs proving that each one successfully triggered automation."

🧠 BONUS: Ask If This Was Done
 Do we have a fallback voice MP3 generator if ElevenLabs fails?

 Are webhook failures being logged to Airtable + console?

 Is there a status endpoint (e.g. /api/health) we can ping for uptime?
