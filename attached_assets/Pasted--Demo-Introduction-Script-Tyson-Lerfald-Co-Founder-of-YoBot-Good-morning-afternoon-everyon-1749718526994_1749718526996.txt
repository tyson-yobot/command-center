🎤 Demo Introduction Script: Tyson Lerfald – Co-Founder of YoBot®
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. My name is Tyson Lerfald, and I'm the Co-Founder of YoBot® — a fully automated AI platform engineered to replace outdated business systems and completely redefine efficiency. I appreciate you joining me today, because what I’m about to show you is not just a product — it’s the future of operations."

AI isn’t coming — it’s here. It’s already disrupting entire industries and quietly rewriting the rules of growth. If you’re not actively leveraging automation in your business right now, you are already behind. In today’s economy, speed, intelligence, and consistency are the real currency — and AI gives you all three.

Take a look at the numbers:

Over 40% of Fortune 500 companies are actively implementing AI to cut labor costs and boost operational throughput.

McKinsey reports AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy.

And businesses that implement AI early are seeing productivity jumps of up to 40% while shrinking support costs by 60–80%.

But this isn’t just about trends or reports. Let’s talk real-world examples:

One logistics firm eliminated two full admin positions by letting YoBot handle client comms, reporting, and QuickBooks syncing — saving over $180,000 per year, instantly.

A startup in Texas replaced its entire lead response team with a YoBot, booked 37 demos in the first month, and now runs lean with no sales reps — and no drop in revenue.

This isn’t optional anymore. It’s a competitive advantage. If you wait until AI is “mainstream,” you’ll be watching your competitors pass you by — faster, cheaper, and 24/7.

And that’s why we built the YoBot® Command Center — the brain behind your AI operation.
This is your mission control for automation. It's where you monitor, customize, and optimize your AI with zero technical complexity.

🧠 Now — let me show you exactly what the Command Center can do.

🎬 Demo Closing Statement
Let me leave you with this:

If you’re still running your business the same way you did five years ago — you are burning money.
Imagine eliminating $300K, $400K, even $500,000 a year in salaries, PTO, sick leave, insurance, vehicles, flights, meals, and missed calls. Then imagine automating all of that with a system that never sleeps, never calls in sick, and only gets smarter over time.

And oh wait — YoBot didn’t just cut costs.
It increased revenue by 47% for one client within the first 90 days by responding faster, converting more leads, and never dropping a single task.

This is the power of true, end-to-end automation.
And YoBot isn’t just another AI tool — it’s ranked in the top 1% of all fully automated business systems for a reason. We’re not just keeping up with the future. We’re building it.

“The only question is — are you ready to stop doing things manually… and start scaling like the top 1%?”
