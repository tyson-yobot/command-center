📘 RECOMMENDED SETUP FOR REPLIT
🧱 Auth Setup
Use Supabase (or Firebase if needed) to manage:

✅ Email/password login

✅ Role tags

✅ Client ID assignment (for tenant scoping)

🧠 Example user.meta Object
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "role": "manager",
  "client_id": "client_xyz",
  "email": "manager@acme.com"
}
🔁 Replit Route Wrappers (Pseudocode)
jsx
Copy
Edit
<AdminOnly>
   {user.role === 'admin' || user.role === 'dev' ? children : redirect('/unauthorized')}
</AdminOnly>

<ClientOnly>
   {user.client_id ? children : redirect('/unauthorized')}
</ClientOnly>

<OwnerOnly>
   {user.role === 'owner' ? children : redirect('/dashboard')}
</OwnerOnly>
✅ What to Build Next
Define Roles in Supabase: admin, dev, support, owner, manager, agent, editor

Assign Client ID to each login (used for Airtable scoping + Make filtering)

Tag Your Current Modules with access level

Route All Users Post-Login based on role → /admin or /dashboard
