YoBot® Command Center – Final Control Panel Structuring Request
Hi team — we’re ready to clean up and finalize the layout of the Control Panel UI to make it user-friendly, scalable, and aligned to product logic.

✅ Primary Goals:
Organize toggles by Package vs Add-On

Reflect exact module names from our pricing sheet

Enable clear preset support for each Bot Package (Starter, Pro, Enterprise, Platinum)

Remove or reclassify anything that is not tied to a system module

📦 1. Core Packages = Preset Toggle Groups
These 4 presets should be available as top-right dropdowns or quick-preset buttons, which when selected, activate only the correct modules:

Starter Bot

Pro Bot

Enterprise Bot

Platinum Bot

Each preset activates modules included in that tier. The full matrix is outlined at the end of this message.

🧩 2. Add-On Modules = Individual Toggles (Under Proper Categories)
These should be set as individually toggled tiles, separate from the core packages, organized under logical sections like:

⚙️ Core System Enhancements:
SmartSpend™ Dashboard

QuickBooks Online Sync

Command Center Pro

Botalytics ROI Dashboard

Predictive Analytics Engine

🤖 AI & Intelligence:
ChatGPT Booster

A/B Script Testing

Custom Personality Pack

Automated Content Generation Studio

Conversational Intelligence Suite

Customer Journey Orchestration

Voice Pattern Recognition & Analysis

Competitive Intelligence Radar

📢 Communication & Conversion:
Slack Notifications

Smart Quoting Engine

Live Transfer Routing

Booking Tool Setup

📡 Lead & Data Tools:
Lead Generation & Scraping Tools

Advanced Data Integration Hub

🧼 3. Clean Up or Reclassify These UI Elements:
From the current image:

❌ Remove: “Scenario Control,” “Error Monitoring,” and any tile that does not tie to a module or system in the pricing sheet.

❌ Remove: Any legacy or unclear tiles (e.g., “PDF Generation” not tied to Smart Quoting)

🌀 Reclassify: “PDF Processor” and “Document Generation” should be grouped under “File Management Tools” only if tied to Smart Quoting or Content Gen.

🧪 Move: Diagnostics execution now lives under ⚙️ Runtime Control, already toggle-aware.

🧪 4. System-Wide Changes
Keep current tile styling

Use exact emoji naming and capitalization from pricing doc

Enable toggle-based state save

All tiles must support Admin/Agent/Viewer role visibility restrictions

Add a “View Only” mode for client dashboards (Viewer Seat logic)
