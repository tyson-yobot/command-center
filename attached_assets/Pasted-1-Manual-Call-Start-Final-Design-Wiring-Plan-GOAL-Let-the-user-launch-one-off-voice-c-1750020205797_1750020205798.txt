1. 🧑‍💼 Manual Call Start — Final Design & Wiring Plan
🎯 GOAL:
Let the user launch one-off voice calls with full context and AI config, direct from the dashboard.

✅ UI Review — What’s Working
Fields are clean and grouped well

Voice, priority, and script all make sense

Nice footer actions (Cancel / Create Call)

🛠️ ADD THIS TO COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY:
A. Required Field Logic
Field	Required?	Note
📞 Phone Number	✅ Yes	Validate formatting
👤 Contact Name	✅ Yes	Autofill from CRM if available
🗣️ Voice	✅ Yes	Use from VoiceBot settings
📝 Script	✅ Yes	Can default to preset (auto-fill option)
📂 Call Type	✅ Yes	e.g., Sales / Support / Follow-up
📑 Additional Notes	❌ Optional	For internal logging only

B. Backend Trigger
POST: /create-manual-call

Payload:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "phone": "+15551234567",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "email": "john@acme.com",
  "call_type": "Sales Call",
  "priority": "Medium",
  "voice_profile": "Default Voice",
  "script": "Hello, this is YoBot calling to...",
  "notes": "Follow-up requested last week"
}
Backend (Replit):

Kicks off Lambda / VoiceBot call

Logs call to 📞 Voice Call Log table

Posts status to 📣 Slack Alerts Log and optionally 📈 Command Center Metrics

✅ Optional Enhancements
Feature	Benefit
🔁 “Use Suggested Script” button	Pulls from VoiceBot Script Tracker
🎧 “Preview Voice” toggle	Plays voice audio before sending
✅ “Auto-log to CRM” toggle	Updates Airtable or HubSpot

❌ 2. Export Dashboard Data — Broken UX Fix
🧠 Issue:
Currently just opens file explorer (blank), then shows an error toast.

✅ Correct UX Flow
What should happen instead:

A. Modal Trigger (like Analytics Report)
Clicking “Export Dashboard Data” should:

Open a modal:

Select format: PDF, CSV, XLSX

Choose sections: SmartSpend, Botalytics, Voice Analytics, Client Metrics

Date range selector: Today, Last 7 Days, Custom

Click “Export” triggers:

POST /export-dashboard

Returns file stream (not local download)

📡 Backend Endpoint
http
Copy
Edit
POST /export-dashboard
Payload Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "format": "xlsx",
  "sections": ["smartspend", "voice_analytics"],
  "date_range": {
    "start": "2025-06-01",
    "end": "2025-06-15"
  }
}
Returns:

Direct download file URL or stream

Logs to 📤 Export Log Table (optional)

✅ REPLIT HANDOFF SUMMARY
Manual Call Start
Validate all required fields

On submit, POST /create-manual-call with contact + script config

Log to Airtable + Slack

Optional: add “Use Suggested Script” + “Preview Voice” buttons

Export Dashboard Data
Clicking button should open a modal (not Explorer)

Let user choose sections + format + date range

Then POST /export-dashboard and trigger file download
