🧠 **YoBot® Task To Do List — Final Spec for Replit Devs**

This document defines **exactly what needs to be done** for each lead scraper module (Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster) and all additional Command Center systems to ensure full functionality, perfect UX, cross-platform compatibility, and sales order automation — with scalability for global deployment.

---

### ✅ Universal Requirements (Apply to All Tools)

* Group filters into logical sections
* Use consistent layout (2-column grid with left/right balance)
* All dropdowns must support default value + full label names
* Every input field should have a label and an optional tooltip ("?")
* Filters should be grouped into sections:

  * 🧑 Contact Filters
  * 🏢 Company/Business Filters
  * ⚙️ Scraping Settings / Execution Settings
* Include bottom bar with:

  * 🔄 Filter summary (e.g. “7 filters applied”)
  * ⏱ Estimated leads/profiles/listings (dynamic)
  * 💾 Save preset button
  * 🚀 Launch button (sticky footer on scroll)
* Toggle between Test Company Mode (fake data, instant) vs YoBot Live Mode (real scraper and live data)
* Color scheme must match the YoBot® Command Center:

  * Apollo: Blue accent (💙)
  * Apify: Green accent (💚)
  * PhantomBuster: Purple accent (💜)
  * Base theme must always be dark navy/gradient, not harsh black
* ✅ Ensure all buttons work (especially all "Add" buttons, dropdowns, and toggles)
* ✅ Replace “Twitter” references with “X (formerly Twitter)”
* ✅ Update PhantomBuster dropdown to say: Platform → LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter)
* ✅ "Use API" option should say: Use YoBot Dashboard instead
* ✅ Email Verified / Phone Verified toggles should default to checked and reflect real verification before sending to HubSpot
* 🚨 All industry dropdowns must dynamically populate from Airtable 📚 Industry Templates table
* 🚨 Test Mode toggle must affect backend response mode — no fake data without toggle ON

### 📣 Command Center Expansion: Immediate Action Items

**None of the current buttons in Command Center work or trigger real functions.** The following must be added, fixed, or replaced with real logic and integration.

#### 🆕 MUST ADD TO COMMAND CENTER:

**1. Social Media Content Creator**
→ New button in `Data & Reports` column labeled `📢 Content Creator`
→ Clicking opens side drawer or modal with:

* Content type selector (Post / Reel / Ad / Email)
* Platform selector (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)
* Voice and tone dropdown (Professional, Funny, Aggressive, Value-Driven)
* Monthly content calendar view
* Auto-generate and export options (PDF, .txt, Airtable push)
* Slack push for daily post
* Save to Airtable `📣 Social Scripts Log`

**2. Mailchimp Integration Manager**
→ New section in `Data & Reports` column labeled `📧 Mailchimp Sync`
→ Controls:

* Audience List dropdown (fetched from Mailchimp)
* Send Campaign / Draft Campaign / Preview
* Connect to latest offer or client funnel via dropdown
* Export lead segment from CRM based on tag
* Track open/click rate to Airtable `📬 Campaign Metrics Log`

**3. ElevenLabs Voice Loader**
→ Load full voice list using:

```js
const fetchVoices = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices', {
    headers: { 'xi-api-key': process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY },
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.voices.map(v => ({ name: v.name, id: v.voice_id }));
};
```

→ Populate dropdown in Voice Generator modal

**4. RAG Document Upload Fix**
→ Required: Accept PDFs → upload → parse → vector store
→ Recommended API flow:

```js
POST /rag-upload
{
  file: PDF,
  tags: ["Client", "Pricing", "FAQ"]
}
```

→ Confirm file indexed & feedback appears in UI

**5. Button Trigger Boilerplate**
→ All UI buttons must send POST with identifier:

```js
await fetch('/api/trigger-module', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ module: 'run_scraper_apollo' }),
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
});
```

→ Button color should flash success/failure

### 🚨 CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL FAILURES (AS OF LATEST SCREENSHOT + FEEDBACK)

* ❌ **File Upload for RAG still broken** — Cannot upload docs, cannot program brain, vector DB not accepting files.
* ❌ **Voice Generator not functional** — ElevenLabs API not properly wired. None of the voices trigger any response.
* ❌ **Still missing all ElevenLabs voice options** — Voice list incomplete. Must display all licensed voices.
* ❌ **Social Media Content Creator still missing entirely** — Not visible or wired anywhere.
* ❌ **Mailchimp Manager still missing** — Not placed in Command Center layout.
* ❌ **No backend functions work for any module or button** — Despite prior tickets and requests, Replit has failed to implement ANY working modules from the UI. No voice, no scraping, no tickets, no AI actions.

🚨 **NEXT STEPS (MUST BE COMPLETED IMMEDIATELY):**

* 🛠 Fix RAG doc uploader — PDF → vector store
* 🎙 Fix ElevenLabs speech generator — connect Voice Generator
* 🎚 Populate full ElevenLabs voice list to dropdown
* 📢 Add and wire Social Content Creator
* 📧 Add and wire Mailchimp Campaign Manager
* 🧠 Wire voice input to chat assistant logic (currently disabled)
* 🔁 All button presses in Command Center must POST to API and update UI
