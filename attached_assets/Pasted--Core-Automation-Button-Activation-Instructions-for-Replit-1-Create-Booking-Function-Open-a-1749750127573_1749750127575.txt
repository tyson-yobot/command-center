🧠 Final Notes to Send Replit
“Each Core Automation button should open a modern modal interface, except for the ‘Sales Order Flow’ which should launch a Tally link. Use consistent styling across all popups, and route the submissions to Make webhooks or our Airtable/CRM targets depending on the function. Forms should be clean, compact, and not require full-page refresh or redirection. Add toast confirmations where appropriate.”
