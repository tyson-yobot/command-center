🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (REPLIT + AIRTABLE)
1. 🔘 Start Pipeline Calls Button
Action:
Triggers Lambda or Replit API to begin outbound voice pipeline

Enhancement Needed:
➡️ When triggered, set a global flag in your Airtable (or Redis/db if Replit backend):

Field	Value
Pipeline Status	Active / Idle
Start Time	Timestamp
Active Call Count	Auto-updated every 5s

This allows any tile to read status instantly.

2. 📞 Live Call Tracking (Airtable Table)
Table: 📞 Voice Call Log
Add or ensure these fields:

Field	Purpose
Call Status	Started, Completed, Failed, In Progress
Pipeline Batch ID	Group calls for today/session
Call Start Time	Use this to calculate daily totals
Conversion	Boolean or Score

This is where all call stats get pulled from.

3. 📊 Voice Analytics Tile – Updated Stats
Use your existing Voice Analytics tile and inject:

Metric	How to Calculate	Source
✅ Calls Today	Count where Call Start Time = TODAY()	📞 Voice Call Log
✅ Avg Duration	AVG(Call End - Call Start)	📞 Voice Call Log
✅ Conversion Rate	# marked converted / total	📞 Voice Call Log
🔄 Calls In Progress	Count where Call Status = In Progress	📞 Voice Call Log
🎯 Calls Remaining	If batch preloaded, subtract in-progress + completed from total	Optional Preload Logic

4. ✅ Visual Indicators on “Start Pipeline Calls” Button
Enhance the button with:

🔄 Loading spinner if active

🔢 Live call count badge: e.g. 5 Active

🟢 Button state = "Active – Pause?" if pipeline is running

5. ✅ Suggested Schema Update in Airtable
Field Name	Type
📞 Call Status	Single select (Queued, Calling, Completed, Failed)
🗓️ Date	Formula from Start Time
📦 Pipeline Run ID	Text or Autonumber
📈 Converted	Checkbox or % field
🎧 Duration	Formula (End - Start)
🧾 Outcome Notes	Long text

✅ Bonus: Optional Auto-Pause Logic
If no contacts remain → set status to Idle

If X errors in a row → trigger alert or Slack

🔁 REPLIT: What to Implement
Track and expose call status via REST (simple JSON endpoint or Redis)

Endpoint /call-status-summary → returns:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "pipelineStatus": "Active",
  "callsToday": 23,
  "inProgress": 3,
  "conversionRate": "21%",
  "avgDuration": "2m 10s"
}
