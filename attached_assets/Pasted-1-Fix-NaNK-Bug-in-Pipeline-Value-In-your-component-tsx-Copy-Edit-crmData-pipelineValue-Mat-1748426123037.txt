1. Fix: $NaNK Bug in Pipeline Value
In your component:

tsx
Copy
Edit
${crmData?.pipelineValue ? Math.round(Number(crmData.pipelineValue) / 1000) + 'K' : '0K'}
But your schema has:

ts
Copy
Edit
pipelineValue: text("pipeline_value").default("$0")
✅ Fix this logic:

Strip $ before converting.

Safeguard against "NaN" output.

Suggested fix:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const numericValue = Number(crmData?.pipelineValue?.replace('$', '') || 0);
const pipelineText = numericValue ? `$${Math.round(numericValue / 1000)}K` : '$0K';
2. Fix: No Logging in Production for res.json()
In index.ts, your res.json() logger is brilliant — but it’s blocked unless path.startsWith("/api").

🔥 Make this configurable. For example:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (process.env.ENABLE_API_LOGGING === 'true') { /* ... */ }
Otherwise, you'll miss critical debugging visibility in production.

🚀 Phase 2 Upgrades (Build for Wow)
1. Add Dark Mode Toggle + System Sync
Let the user toggle between light/dark or inherit OS preference. Bonus: use tailwindcss-dark-mode plugin.

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Button onClick={() => toggleTheme()}>Toggle Theme</Button>
2. Add Real-Time WebSocket Push for Metrics
You're showing values like:

📞 Calls Today

🟢 System Health

Make those live update using WebSocket events:

ts
Copy
Edit
socket.emit('metricUpdate', { callsToday: 250 });
Back this with a Redis pub/sub or use Supabase Realtime if you're trying to stay lean.

3. Add Notification Feed With Filters
You already have a notifications table with:

ts
Copy
Edit
type: lead_captured | call_escalation | meeting_booked
Add a right-rail component with:

Live feed updates

Filter by type

"Mark all as read"

4. Embed AI Voice Simulation or Debug Console
Add a bottom card in the Voice section:

Show the recognized command

Show intent parsed

Show action triggered

Helps with transparency + debugging + looks cool as hell.

5. Power Mode / CEO Mode Switch
Let Daniel and you flip a switch for:

💼 CEO View: Topline stats only

🔧 Ops Mode: All logs, toggles, routing logic, escalation review

💡 Final Suggestions
💾 Add Export: JSON & PDF Export buttons for full session summaries.

🧠 Add RAG Logs: Show real-time query history + result sources.

🛑 Red Alert Trigger: Add timer-based logic to escalate calls if not handled in X mins.

📆 Full Calendar Sync: Sync with Google/Outlook calendar APIs (OAuth2 flow).

📊 Dashboard Templates: Let users toggle between “Sales Mode”, “Support Mode”, etc.
