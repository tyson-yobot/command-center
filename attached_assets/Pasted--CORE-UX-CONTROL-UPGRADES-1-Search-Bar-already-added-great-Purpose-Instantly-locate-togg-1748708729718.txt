✅ CORE UX & CONTROL UPGRADES
1. 🔍 Search Bar (already added — great)
Purpose: Instantly locate toggles as module list grows.

Good job: This is live in the new screenshot — keep it!

2. 🧑‍⚖️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Purpose: Only show toggles based on user role (Admin, Client, Support, Reseller).

How:

Add a visibleTo property per module.

Hide restricted toggles from non-admins.

Show a 🔒 icon or a lockout overlay if needed.

3. 🟢 Real-Time Status Indicators
Purpose: Show whether a module is actively working, not just “on.”

Status icons next to each toggle:

✅ = On & healthy

⚠️ = Warning (e.g., webhook lag, 429 error)

❌ = On but failing

How: Ping module or check last API/log result every 60s or on toggle.

4. 📋 Action Log Console
Purpose: See real-time toggle results without leaving the panel.

Add a button: 🔧 View Logs or 🪵 Action Console

⚙️ ADMIN / OPS AUTOMATION FEATURES
5. 💣 Emergency STOP Group Toggle
You added this already — nice touch.

Suggestion: Make it flash red if any critical path module fails (QuickBooks, HubSpot, VoiceBot Core).

6. 📦 Preset Module Bundles
Purpose: Apply toggle presets for different packages (e.g., Starter, Pro, Platinum, Custom).

Add dropdown or buttons:

📦 Starter Plan, 🚀 Pro Plan, 💎 Platinum Plan

Auto-toggle matching modules and disable extras.

7. 📁 Client-Specific Views / Profiles
Purpose: Each client only sees what they purchased.

How:

On login, load a toggle profile based on CRM ID.

Limit visibility based on contract line items.

📊 VISUAL/STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS
8. 🧩 Category Collapse / Expand
Allow collapsing categories (e.g., “Webhook Management”).

Helps if you scale to 10+ sections.

9. 🧠 Tooltip / Help Icon per Module
Add small “ℹ️” icons with hover text or mini docs.

Example:

Lead Scoring ℹ️ → “Scores leads based on custom criteria in Airtable. Auto-ranks top 10 daily.”

10. 📈 Analytics Panel or Usage Heatmap
Optional but powerful:

Show when each module was last used

Color code high-usage modules

Warn about “unused for 30 days” logic to deactivate
