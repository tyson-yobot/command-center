WHAT TO BUILD (REPLIT INSTRUCTIONS)
1. 🧠 Add a “View Knowledge Memory” Button
Right below “Memory Text Insertion” and next to “Upload Documents,” add:

Button: 🗂 View Knowledge Library

On click → open a modal window with:
A list view of all stored items (documents, manual text entries)

Display:

📝 Name

🕓 Date uploaded

🧠 Memory Type (Manual vs Document)

📦 Size

Action icons next to each item:

🔍 Preview

🗑 Delete

✏️ Edit Title

🪪 View Source Type (text/file)

2. 📖 Add "Preview Memory/Doc" Popup
When clicking 🔍 Preview:

Open a scrollable modal with:

Document name

Formatted text preview

Optional tags or linked memory category

Button: “Remove from Memory”

3. 🧾 Upload Documents Panel — Add Live Status + Options
Instead of just listing “YoBot Price List.docx,” show:

Filename	Status	Date Uploaded	Options
YoBot Price List.docx	✅ Indexed	Jun 12, 2025	🔍 Preview

Also add a visual spinner or green checkmark next to “Status” during upload → indexing.

4. ✅ Replace “Memory Inserted Successfully” Toast with Logs
Replace the tiny green toast with a section labeled:

🧠 Latest Memory Activity Log

Shows last 5 inserts with:

Timestamp

Type (Manual / File)

Category

Result (✅ Success / ❌ Error)

5. 🧰 Backend / Replit Notes:
Have your dev implement this as:

Store docs in a retrievable JSON or markdown format linked to their filename, with metadata (timestamp, source, type)

Link all memory entries to a table or memory_index.json file

On “View Knowledge Library” → Load JSON entries + document content from that index

All deletes/edit actions update both the visual UI and that stored JSON

✅ FINAL USER FLOW (RECOMMENDED)
User uploads file → sees live status + preview option

User inserts memory → it gets logged visibly with edit/delete control

User clicks “View Knowledge Library” → opens modal with all current memory entries

User can preview any item, rename, or delete

On hover, show full title + option to relabel

If user clears memory, show undo/confirm modal to prevent accidental wipe
