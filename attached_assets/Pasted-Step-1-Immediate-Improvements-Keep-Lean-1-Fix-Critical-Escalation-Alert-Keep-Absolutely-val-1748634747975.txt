Step 1: Immediate Improvements (Keep Lean)
🛠️ 1. Fix Critical Escalation Alert
Keep: Absolutely valid.

Action: Ensure red bar isn’t just test/static. Must show real-time scenario failures, missed follow-ups, or broken automations.

Enhancement: Rename to 🚨 System Alerts and feed it from Make failure webhooks.

➕ 2. Add Bot Health Overview (Consolidated)
Yes to this, but don’t list each bot individually unless scoped.

✅ Suggested replacement:

🤖 Bot Health Monitor

Total Bots: [#]

Avg Response Time: [#s]

Current Errors: [X bots impacted]

Worst Performer: [Bot Name]

Uptime Status: ✅/⚠️/❌

Why: Scalable, and can be filtered by client or tier later.

🧠 3. Add Revenue Forecasting
Yes, but simplify. No need for quarterly heat maps here.

📈 Revenue Forecast

MRR: $[#]

Projected 30d: $[#]

Pipeline Deals: [#]

Confidence %: [#%]

Feeds from: Quotes + current pipeline values + active subscriptions.

👥 4. Add Client Tier View (Optional Toggle)
Yes, but don’t display all the time.

Add a toggle button on top: Filter by Tier → [Enterprise | SMB | Internal]

Filters metrics below without cluttering visual space.

🚨 Step 2: Missing Essential Features (Revised)
✅ 1. Client Pulse Summary
🧭 Client Pulse

Active Clients: [#]

Client NPS: [#/100]

Churn Risk Flags: [X accounts]

Last Login: [Avg Days Ago]

Why: Keeps customer health front and center without overloading per-client data.

⚙️ 2. Operational Metrics (Merged into One Card)
📊 Ops Metrics

Avg Bot Response Time: [#s]

Success Rate: [#%]

Error Trend (7d): [# errors ↗︎/↘︎]

API Usage %: [#% of plan]

Why: Don’t break into separate widgets. One tight module = less clutter.
