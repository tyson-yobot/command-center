💡 Top Suggestions for the RAG Screen (Based on Command Center Context)
1. ✅ Add Real-Time Usage Indicators (Live Intelligence)
Each knowledge card should show:

Last used: “2 hours ago via VoiceBot”

Usage count (7d): “12 times”

Trigger sources: Icons for 🧠 Voice, 💬 Chat, 📝 Forms, 🎯 Intent Match

🎯 Why: You’re tracking bot health, error rates, workflows — but the knowledge base has zero visibility into live use. You need insight into what’s working and what’s getting ignored.

2. 🧠 Confidence Threshold Override Per Entry
Let operators set:

“Only use if confidence ≥ 92%” or “Inject always, even if weak”

🎯 Why: You already use confidence scores elsewhere — make it functional, not just display. It should directly affect whether the bot uses that entry.

3. 🛑 Flag High-Risk or Outdated Entries
Auto-flag entries if:

Not used in 30+ days

Repeatedly lead to fallback/escalation

Overridden by a manual reply

🎯 Why: Keeps your RAG clean and accurate. Let the system surface weak links so operators don’t have to guess.

4. 🔄 Learning Loop Button
Add a small button:
“Promote Transcript → Knowledge”

🎯 Why: Tie the RAG system to what you’re already tracking in Conversation Analytics. If a rep or VA sees a strong manual answer in a call/chat, they should be able to one-click send it to RAG as a pending draft.

5. 📌 Tie Tags to Command Center Filters
If an entry is tagged RefundPolicy, let that become clickable in Conversation Analytics or AI Insights.
Example:

Click → show all recent bot replies that used RefundPolicy

🎯 Why: Allows tracking injection logic backward to where it came from. Perfect for root-cause QA and system audits.

6. 🧩 Module Filter (Dropdown)
Add a filter dropdown like:

VoiceBot

ZendeskBot

TrainingBot

SalesFlow AI

🎯 Why: In Command Center, you’ve separated modules clearly. RAG screen should mirror that — operators want to see what supports their department.

7. 📊 RAG Injection Analytics Card
Mirror the Command Center feel. At the top of the RAG screen, add a stats card:

diff

Edit
🧠 This Week's Knowledge Performance
- Entries Used: 87
- Avg. Confidence: 94.2%
- Escalation Rate Post-Injection: 2.3%
- Most Used: "HIPAA Compliance Response"
🎯 Why: Brings RAG to life as an active system, not a static database. It should feel alive — just like the rest of your dashboard.

🧠 Final Thought
Right now, the RAG screen is a library.
You need it to function like an injection engine.
