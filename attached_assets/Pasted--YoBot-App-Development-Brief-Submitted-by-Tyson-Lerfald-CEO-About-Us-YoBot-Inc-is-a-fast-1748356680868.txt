YoBot®, Inc. is a fast-scaling AI automation company. We build hyper-custom chatbots, VoiceBots, CRM integrations, and automation layers for startups, agencies, and service pros across the U.S. Our tools replace manual sales and support roles with smart automation.

We are now looking to expand into mobile with a dedicated app that gives our clients real-time access to their AI systems, dashboards, and automation logs.

🔹 Purpose of the App
We want this app to be the control center for business owners who are using YoBot® bots. The core goals are:

On-the-go visibility into their bot’s performance

Real-time alerts for leads, payments, or issues

Fast actions like sending quotes, approving expenses, or triggering voice flows
