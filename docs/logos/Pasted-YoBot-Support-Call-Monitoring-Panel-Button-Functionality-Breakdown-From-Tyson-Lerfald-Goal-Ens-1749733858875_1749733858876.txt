YoBot Support + Call Monitoring Panel — Button Functionality Breakdown
From: Tyson Lerfald
Goal: Ensure all buttons across both panels are fully functional, visually polished, and reflect real system behavior. Here's the exact breakdown:

🎯 PANEL 1: 📞 Call Monitoring Panel
✅ Monitoring Service, Recording Service, Analytics Service
Start
➤ Initiates the respective service
➤ Button turns green and status changes to “🟢 ACTIVE”
➤ Update the "Last ping" timestamp live

Restart
➤ Performs a soft reboot of the selected service
➤ Status updates to “🔄 RESTARTING” then back to "🟢 ACTIVE"

Ping
➤ Sends a ping to the backend to confirm health
➤ Show result with a toast message (e.g. ✅ Ping successful or ❌ Ping failed)
➤ Optional: log ping response in the console or debug modal

🔘 Simulate Test Call
Triggers a mock call event in the system (non-live)

Increments “Active Calls” to 1 temporarily
