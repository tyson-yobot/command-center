✅ What’s Working Incredibly Well
🧠 Live Intelligence Dashboard
“Entries Used,” “Avg. Confidence,” “Escalation Rate,” and “Active Sources” are exactly what was missing — this matches the executive insight feel of the Command Center.

Bonus points for “Most Used” surfacing dynamically. That’s gold for QA.

🎯 Per-Entry Operational Metrics
“Last used,” “Usage (7d),” “Trigger Sources,” and “Min Confidence” = excellent.

You're now tracking how and when each block was used, which is essential for reliability control and knowledge pruning.

🏷 Clean Visual Tags and Status Indicators
The chip-style tags (VoiceBot, Compliance, etc.) with icon-level metadata give clean visibility per card.

🔧 7 Sharp Improvements to Take This from Great → Elite
1. 🔁 Injection Path Preview Button
Add a “👁 Preview Injection” icon per card.

💡 When clicked, show:

Sample output as used in VoiceBot or Zendesk

What part of the prompt it was injected into

Optionally, what it replaced or appended

🎯 Why: Confirms the block is firing as expected. Great for QA and avoids guesswork with formatting/tone mismatches.

2. ⚠️ Error Risk Flag
Auto-flag entries if:

They're injected but lead to a follow-up escalation

They’re overridden manually by support agents

They have low engagement (e.g., 3 uses, 2 escalations)

🎯 Why: Helps operators catch weak or misleading entries and remove them before they affect CX.

3. 📤 Promote Transcript to Knowledge
Let support agents or admins promote recent Zendesk responses or VoiceBot transcripts into a new knowledge block.

Button: “📈 Promote from Logs”

🎯 Why: Enables fast, real-world RAG training without leaving the interface. Your system learns from real usage, not just admin planning.

4. 🔎 Advanced Search + Filters Panel
Right now search is basic. Add:

Filter by: Tag, Confidence, Trigger Source, Min Confidence, Escalation Rate

Sort by: Usage, Last Modified, Alphabetical

🎯 Why: As you grow to 50+ entries, this becomes critical. You’ll want to audit behavior by role or feature quickly.

5. 👤 Role Visibility Control
Optional: let each entry be assigned to specific bots or teams:

Visible to: All, VoiceBot only, SupportBot, SalesBot, Internal only

🎯 Why: Avoids leakage or tone mismatch across bots. Especially useful when some responses are public-facing and others are internal scripts.

6. 📆 Last Reviewed + Owner Field
Each entry should display:

🛠 Owner (admin who created or last edited it)

🔁 Last Reviewed Date (manually updateable)

🎯 Why: As multiple admins contribute, version control and accountability matter — especially when something breaks.

7. 🗂 Batch Mode for Tagging / Confidence / Archiving
Let admins:

Select multiple entries → apply tags, update confidence thresholds, or archive in bulk

🎯 Why: Huge timesaver when refining or categorizing groups of entries post-import or system audit.

🧠 Optional Advanced Bonus: RAG Injection Logs Panel
A tab (or collapsible drawer) on the right:

“🧠 RAG Injections Log — This Week”

Time, source (VoiceBot, Zendesk, etc.)

Knowledge entry used

Result: ✅ success / ⚠️ escalated

🎯 Why: Fully closes the loop — from knowledge block → to injection → to result.
