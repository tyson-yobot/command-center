Version: Final | Owner: Tyson Lerfald
Purpose: Set up and test the full automation infrastructure end-to-end

📂 FILE STRUCTURE TO SET UP
Create the following files in your Replit project:

bash
Copy
Edit
project-root/
├── integration_logger.py     # Airtable logging + Slack + Email alerts
├── test_runner.py            # Loop + auto-logger for all functions
├── function_library.py       # Will contain 50+ real logic function names
├── .env                      # (if separating secrets – optional)
🔧 STEP-BY-STEP TASK LIST
✅ 1. SET UP AIRTABLE LOGGER
File: integration_logger.py
Already written — copy from canvas.

It does all this:

Logs every function’s result to your Airtable table

Sends Slack alert on failure (Slack Webhook already wired)

Sends email to Tyson and Daniel on failure (tyson@yobot.bot, daniel@yobot.bot)

💡 Action Required:
Replace these 2 fields in the file:

python
Copy
Edit
SMTP_USER = "your_email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS = "your_password"
Use a real Gmail and App Password.

✅ 2. SET UP TEST HARNESS
File: test_runner.py
Already written — copy from canvas.

It does this:

Finds all functions that start with function_

Runs them

Logs the result via log_integration_test_to_airtable(...)

✅ 3. POPULATE function_library.py
File: function_library.py

You’ll either:

Paste the 50+ real function names from Tyson’s roadmap (provided separately), OR

Call real function logic from existing modules like:

python
Copy
Edit
from voicebot.transcription import transcribe_call

def function_voicebot_transcription_logger():
    return transcribe_call("test")
💡 DO NOT rename function names. They must match function_* format to be recognized by test_runner.py.

✅ 4. RUN THE SYSTEM
Run the following in Replit’s shell:

bash
Copy
Edit
python test_runner.py
✅ If passed → logs to Airtable
❌ If failed → logs to Airtable, sends Slack alert, sends email

🧪 WHAT TO VERIFY
Integration	Result	Test Confirmation
Airtable Logging	✅	Row appears
Slack Alert	✅	Message shows on Slack
Email Alert	✅	Tyson & Daniel get email
Function Run	✅	Console shows log success/fail

🧱 BACKUP: FILE CONTENT LOCATION
Tyson’s current canvas includes:

integration_logger.py (Slack + Email + Airtable)

test_runner.py

Placeholder mention for function_library.py

Do not alter naming, order, or alert logic.

🛡️ DO NOT:
Do not add fake 1000+ integrations

Do not rename functions

Do not overwrite any Slack webhook, Airtable key, or function structure

✅ READY FOR GO-LIVE WHEN:
50+ automations are verified and passing

Slack + Email alerts are firing on true failure

Tally → Airtable → Stripe/HubSpot/VoiceBot/QuickBooks workflows are tested
