FUNCTIONAL & DESIGN FIXES BY MODULE
🔹 Core Automation Buttons
✅ Good clarity. Consider tooltips for each action.

💡 Improvement: Add small status icon next to each button when recently used (✓ or 🔄).

🔹 Voice & Communication
✅ Good layout. Consider adding a "Live Status" bar to show if pipeline is open or idle.

⚠️ Color usage: All buttons are red/yellow/green = looks like error indicators.

✅ Suggest neutral colors + action icons to reduce visual panic.

🔹 Data & Reports
🎯 Add icons to each button (📊 📥 🧾 ✏️ 📧)

🧠 Tooltips: On hover, show what each does. E.g., “View PDF Report → Shows the most recent generated quote for this client.”

🔹 Live Automation Engine
✅ Looks solid.

🧠 Suggest adding a “Last Execution” timestamp and maybe a 💾 download log or 🧠 View Last Run link.

🔹 Client Pulse
✅ Strong branding.

⚠️ Suggest one visible warning per card. "0 flagged" in red seems alarming even if it’s good. Green or gray is better unless something is actually wrong.

🔹 SmartSpend™ & Botalytics™
🔥 Excellent layout.

✅ Suggest adding filters (Monthly / Quarterly / Custom) and Export PDF or Export CSV buttons.

🔹 AI Assistant Insights + Conversation Tools
✅ Looks sleek.

🧠 Add “Last Update” timestamp to show recency of learning, RAG, etc.

🔹 Voice Commands + Calendar
✅ Smart UX.

Suggest: Add a mic icon to each command prompt block to simulate a voice click demo.

Add “Today’s Agenda” summary up top with meetings, tasks, and next call.

🔹 RAG Knowledge Base
💡 Enhancement: Add a floating “Need Help?” button inside the RAG area to show how to query, like:

"Try: 'Summarize my 2024 invoices'"

"Try: 'What did Tyson say during the AMT66 meeting?'"

🔹 Voice Synthesis & Persona
✅ Functional, but feels buried. Suggest moving this higher up or under a "VoiceBot Studio" tab.

Add: Dropdown presets for persona names like “Ella | Support AI” or “Sam | Sales Closer”

🔹 Call Monitoring + Support Panel
✅ Looks amazing after relocation.

💡 Suggest:

Replace “No Tickets” with demo/test ticket to make it look active.

Allow real-time ping result log to display in small log console.

Add Alert Banner on top: 📢 Next Scheduled Voice Test: Today @ 2PM
