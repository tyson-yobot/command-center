What's Missing vs. Your UI Screenshots
Step 1: Essential Components Needed

Dashboard KPI Cards - The 247 calls, 89 deals metrics
Live Status Indicators - The green dots showing bot is active
Navigation Bar - Bottom tab navigation system

Step 2: Backend Integration Requirements

Real-time WebSocket connection for live updates
Database schema for leads, calls, deals tracking
CRM data persistence layer

Immediate Replit Action Items
Create these core files:

src/components/Dashboard.tsx - Main command center
src/components/Navigation.tsx - Bottom tab bar
src/components/KPICard.tsx - Metric display cards
src/hooks/useRealTimeData.tsx - Live data management

Should I provide the exact component code specifications, or do you want me to focus on the database/backend architecture first?TLKeep in mind that we are going full automation eventually.  We are about 85% there right now.  We need a badass app! :)Got it! You're building the ultimate automated bot empire. Looking at your screenshots and 85% automation level, here's what will make this app absolutely badass:
