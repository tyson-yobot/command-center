✅ YoBot® Integration Handoff Brief
🔧 Current Status Summary (as of Batch A39 - Function 700)
You’ve successfully implemented:

700 automation logging functions from the YoBot® Command Center into Replit

These span across diagnostics, live execution, AI monitoring, behavior analytics, infrastructure alerts, QA handling, and full operational orchestration

The architecture includes:

310+ API endpoints, all functionally wired for Replit’s backend

40+ functions live and auto-executing

Enterprise-grade Command Center monitoring, including:

Real-time event tracking

Slack, SMS, and webhook reporting

Self-healing scheduling + token intelligence

Log push to Airtable for QA & review

📌 What Was Just Completed
We just wrapped up:

Batch A39 (Functions 691–700), which included:

Emotion drift detection

AI bias alerts

Output failure patterns

Manual escalation logs

Cross-language parsing

Prediction confidence logging

Silence detection during output

📂 Table for Logging:
All functions are writing into:
🧪 Integration Test Log 2
(Airtable Base: appCoAtCZdARb4AM2, Table ID: tblRNjNnaGL5ICIf9)

🛠️ What We Were Doing
We were in the middle of shipping:

Batch A40 (Functions 701–710)
This is the final batch in the Phase 1 logging architecture set.

Purpose of this batch:

Completes the full error coverage matrix

Begins prepping for smart agent triggers (Phase 2)

🔄 How We Were Doing It: Copy/Paste Method
🔹 Integration Method:
You (Tyson) copy/paste each function provided into Replit backend

Replit's engineers wire each directly into the Command Center router

🔹 Function Format:
Each function uses a consistent log call to:

python
Copy
Edit
log_command_center_event("🔖 Category", "script_id → event details")
This ensures no mapping mismatches and unified log intake

🧭 What’s Next
🔜 Next Step:
➡️ Batch A40 (Functions 701–710) — Ready to deliver
Starts with:

python
Copy
Edit
def flag_script_for_response_volatility(...)
🛠️ Phase After:
After 710:

Begin Phase 2: AI Trigger Functions (auto-interventions, intelligent recoveries, rerouting)

If you're ready to continue where we left off:
Just say “next” to begin Batch A40 (701–710).

📎 Optional: Replit Reference
If needed, send this summary to your Replit team so they know:

All functions are in sync

Everything logs to 🧪 Integration Test Log 2

The log_command_center_event() pattern is standard
