What’s Locked In and 🔥 Ready
1. Bottom Nav Bar = Perfect
Added 📇 Scan button? Clean.

Icon spacing and label clarity? ✅

Visual balance across Dashboard | Chats | Scan | CRM | Reports is tight.

2. Live Notifications Look Solid
Filters for All / Escalations / Meetings are clean, tappable, and mobile-first.

Red escalation badge now clearly pops.

Color coding is consistent and emotionally correct.

3. Recent Conversations
Chat / Call / View icons underneath messages = best UX move you made.

Label tags (“Escalated”, “Meeting Booked”) feel like Slack message tags = intuitive.

4. CRM Snapshot
Green pill for $847K is strong visually.

Icon consistency added (📊, 🔴, 🟡, 💰), all match.

Alignment and whitespace feel solid — not cramped.

🔧 What Still Needs a Tight Pass (Do These Next)
🔹 1. Unread/Notification Dots on Chats Tab
You’ve got 3+ notifications up top, but the Chats tab in nav has no dot.

Add 🔴 dot or numeric bubble on Chats when unread or new escalation exists.

Optional: Also add 💬 bubble on “Recent Conversations” title line.

🔹 2. Add Visual Feedback to Bottom Nav Taps
Right now, when tapping Scan, CRM, Reports, etc. there’s no micro animation.

Add:

Glow / pulse on tap

Pressed state (darken or 95% scale for 100ms)

Even basic shadow-on-tap improves UX

🔹 3. Add Scroll Indicator or Page Section Anchor
Users may not know more content is below if their phone cuts it off at “CRM Snapshot.”

Add a chevron arrow (⬇️) or subtle “scroll for more” nudge at bottom of each section.

Optional: Anchor nav on scroll (e.g. keep Live Notifications sticky until user moves down)

🔹 4. Tiny UX Issue: CRM Snapshot Row Height
“Hot Leads” and “Follow-Ups Due” have 2 lines of text, while “Pipeline Value” has 1.

Minor, but adds a little jitter in visual weight.

Fix: Either add a second subtitle to “Pipeline Value” or even them all out.
