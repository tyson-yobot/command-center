## 🧾 FULL SCRIPT TO COPY INTO ELEVENLABS (Word-for-Word)

"Hi, I’m Tyson — founder of YoBot®. You’re looking at a real command center that runs sales, support, reports, lead scraping, voice calls, and ROI — all from one screen. We built this to automate every part of your business. Let me show you what it can do.

Let’s start with Core Automation. These buttons aren’t shortcuts — they’re full workflows. One click handles multiple systems behind the scenes. But more than that, they eliminate the decision fatigue of bouncing between platforms. It’s built to be used by anyone — no training needed.

Booking Sync automatically captures lead form data, adds it into Airtable, assigns the rep, sends a Slack ping, and stores everything in the CRM. You’re notified instantly.

Support Ticket creates a new Zendesk ticket, attaches the relevant client details, and updates their record. No logging in to multiple apps — support is now fully tracked.

Manual Follow-up? It doesn’t just create a task — it schedules a reminder, alerts your rep, and connects back to your smart calendar.

Sales Orders? That’s an entire flow: invoice triggered, Stripe activated, QuickBooks updated, client notified.

SMS? You’re not copy/pasting. This button sends the right text to the right lead using live data tags — fully integrated with Twilio.

Now to Communication.

Start Pipeline Calls to queue outbound dials through your voice engine. These aren’t static lists — YoBot® personalizes each call using lead data and tracks the results.

Initiate Voice Call gives you manual control when you want to hop in and speak.

Voice Input is your shortcut for command-based automation. Just say, “Schedule follow-up with Brian next Thursday” — and it’s done.

Now let’s slow it down and dig into something you’ll love: the Content Creator.

Click this, and YoBot® becomes your writer.

Choose a format — email, voicemail, social caption, cold DM. Then choose the voice: professional, casual, high-energy, persuasive.
Add your product or service, and hit Generate.

It builds you custom, high-converting content in seconds — all ready to deploy.

Now — let’s go deeper.
Click Run Lead Scrape.
Choose your tool — let’s say Apollo.
From here, apply filters: industry, job title, location, phone and email required, company size, tech stack, and more. Once set, YoBot® scrapes the data, deduplicates it, scores each lead based on your preferences, and sends it into your system.

You don’t touch a CSV file. You don’t hire a VA. You just have leads — ready to go.

You want reports? Click PDF Report. It compiles all selected fields, creates a branded document in Google Docs, and exports it as a client-ready PDF.

Export Data syncs everything to Google Sheets, Airtable, or your connected database.

Mailchimp Sync pushes fresh leads into the right campaign segment. No extra steps.

\[CAMERA BREAK — CEO PITCH]

Let’s pause. Imagine this replacing your sales assistant, your tech VA, your cold caller, your analytics guy, and your scheduling coordinator. That’s what YoBot® does.

Our clients save 360+ hours in their first 60 days — and they’re not slowing down. If you’re trying to scale without more staff, this isn’t software — this is your growth engine.

Let’s keep going.

Back on the dashboard — let’s talk **Live Support**.

At the bottom corner, we’ve got 24/7 live chat powered by a combination of AI triage and human escalation. Customers get immediate answers, and when something needs a person, the handoff is smooth.

No form fills. No waiting hours. Just answers.

Let’s get into **Botalytics™ and SmartSpend™**.

Here’s what you’ll see:

* **ROI %** — based on revenue tracked vs YoBot® package cost
* **Cost per Lead** — actual cost per usable, verified lead
* **Lead Quality Score** — based on your selected criteria: email/phone availability, industry fit, engagement
* **Close Rate** — synced from deal stages or invoice tracking
* **Budget Efficiency** — how well your spend is converting to closed business
* **Payback Period** — number of days YoBot® paid for itself

These are not vanity stats — they’re actionable. They tell you what’s working, what needs to be optimized, and how fast you’re moving.

Now — let’s wrap with the bottom control bar.

The Live Activity Feed shows everything in motion: lead scrapes completed, calls triggered, SMS sent, PDF generated, support escalated.

Voice Assistant lets you trigger functions hands-free. Say, “Create PDF for John Doe,” or “Send quote to new lead.”

Memory Text Insertion allows you to save standard answers, disclaimers, or onboarding lines and instantly inject them into emails, SMS, or calls.

Smart Calendar shows all tasks, follow-ups, and bookings auto-created by the system — with manual overrides if needed.

And finally, the RAG module. Ask it anything about your customer’s documents, your SOPs, or knowledge base, and it pulls accurate, grounded responses. It doesn’t hallucinate — it only references what you gave it.

So what do you have here?

A control tower.
A lead engine.
A voice agent.
A full-service CRM, communicator, and performance dashboard — that works even when you don’t.

This is YoBot®.
If you’re ready to scale, let’s launch your bot now."
