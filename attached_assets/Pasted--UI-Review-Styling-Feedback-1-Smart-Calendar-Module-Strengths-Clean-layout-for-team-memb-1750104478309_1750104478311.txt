🔧 UI Review + Styling Feedback
1. 🗓️ Smart Calendar Module
✅ Strengths:
Clean layout for team members.

Weekly toggle with highlight for "Today".

Action buttons for scheduling are well-placed.

🔄 Fixes:
Area	Suggestion
Styling	Add glassmorphism effect or gradient border like your main cards (rgba(13, 130, 218, 0.15) with a #0d82da glow border).
Font	Use same weight + size as dashboard headers for day labels.
Calendar Strip	Current days (Sun–Sat) look very flat. Add hover state + faint background color shift for clickability.
Card Borders	Add subtle hover/outline effect or drop shadow to each team card (like a raised state).
Meeting Summary Row	Add section borders or colored dot legends like SmartSpend™ charts.
Additions:	
- Show number of meetings in each user card if empty: "0 Scheduled"	
- Display a tooltip or popup on hover with next meeting detail.	
- Possibly make user roles (CEO, CTO, etc.) clickable filters.	

2. 🆘 Create Support Ticket Modal
✅ Strengths:
Form is minimal and intuitive.

Escalation logic is built-in.

🔄 Fixes:
Area	Suggestion
Styling	Modal uses a different color theme (dark w/ neon green). Match base UI colors — ideally deep blue background with lighter input fields.
Input Fields	Add icons to each field (✉️ for email, 📝 for subject, 🧯 for urgency) like you did for call form.
Button Styling	Green “Submit Ticket” is strong, but add a hover effect and make the Cancel button a lighter gray (vs flat black).
Text Size	"Requires immediate escalation" could be more legible — try making it bold or using color if toggled.

3. 📞 Manual Call Start Modal
✅ Strengths:
Has full context for outbound call logic.

Great use of default inputs and script field.

🔄 Fixes:
Area	Suggestion
Spacing	Needs padding between form sections — especially between company/email and dropdowns.
Input Labels	Use your UI’s card header font style and left-align everything.
Dropdowns	Add custom icons per dropdown (🔊 Voice Profile, 🗣️ Call Type).
Voice Profile Picker	Use a rounded chip dropdown (like Slack channel selector).
Styling Consistency	Replace solid black with dark navy #111827 and neon blue accents to match dashboard.
Button Group	“Cancel” should be an outlined button. “Create Call” should match your Start Pipeline Call button — glowing with a hover transition.

✨ Bonus: Global Styling Suggestion
You should consider creating a UI Style Token System for modals:

Base Modal Container: border-radius: 10px, backdrop-filter: blur(12px), shadow 0 0 10px rgba(13,130,218,0.2)

Inputs: padding: 12px, border: 1px solid #2c2c2e, glow on focus

Primary Buttons: gradient background, hover scale

Use consistent emoji headers like 📞 Manual Call, 🗓️ Calendar, 🆘 Ticket
