🔊 VOICE COMMAND UI — "Live Voice Command" Fixes
🧠 Problem:
The current state only says “Listening” — no clarity on what's happening.

✅ Fix:
Add active prompt & animation feedback:

UI Update	Description
🟢 Show text: "🎙️ Speak Now..."	Appears when mic is open
📊 Add voice waveform	Use animated bars or waveform GIF under button
🔴 Show "❌ Cancel" button	In case they want to stop
🧠 Optional: show real-time transcription (like ChatGPT's Whisper UI)	

Backend:
Track mic status in state variable (mic_status = idle/listening/processing) — feed it to UI renderer.

📈 "Generate Analytics Report" — Upgrade UX Flow
🧠 Problem:
Currently auto-saves a generic file, no preview, no format options.

✅ Fix:
Trigger a popup modal with:

Field	Options
📊 Report Type	Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom
📁 Sections	Botalytics, SmartSpend, Voice Analytics
📄 Format	PDF, CSV, XLSX
🔘 Action	[Generate Preview] [Print] [Download]

Allow it to remember last-used options.

📅 SMART CALENDAR — Integration Upgrade
🧠 Problem:
Calendar tile doesn't wire to external sources; not shareable or extendable.

✅ Fixes:
Feature	Action
📥 Upload external calendar (ICS, CSV, Google)	Drag/drop or upload modal
🔗 Sync with Google Calendar	Use Google Calendar API for one-way sync
⏳ Show 7-day projection	View = “This week” summary with meetings
🔍 Optional: show agent filters or categories	

🎨 Appearance & UX Suggestions
✅ General Clean-Up / Improvements:
Icons Missing Tooltips

All voice & system icons should show hover tips (e.g., "Start Voice", "Reset Pipeline")

Loading Indicators

Add spinners for buttons that trigger backend events (e.g., “Start Pipeline”, “Generate Report”)

Voice Pipeline = No Indicator

Add “🟢 Live Now (3 calls running)” bar near top when pipeline is active

Error Catching

If voice, analytics, or sync tiles fail to load, display friendly retry message (not blank space)

Consistent Tile Height

Some cards (e.g., Voice Analytics vs SmartSpend™) are different heights — align them visually

Dashboard Presets

Option to switch between views: “Voice Ops Only”, “SmartSpend Only”, “Full Ops View”

✅ Summary: What To Hand Off to Replit Now
Please implement the following:

Voice Command UI – Display "🎙️ Speak now..." + animated waveform and cancel option when live listening is active.

Voice Pipeline – Show a mini live call banner when pipeline is active (e.g. 4 calls running).

Analytics Report Button – Trigger a modal where user chooses report type, format, sections, and then generates preview/download.

Calendar Tile – Add calendar upload capability (ICS/CSV), with Google Calendar API sync and 7-day week forecast.

Global Enhancements – Add tooltips, tile alignment, button loading indicators, and graceful error handling.

Let us know once the visual state, calendar logic, and voice feedback are live. Happy to help wire it to Airtable if needed.
