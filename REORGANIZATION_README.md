# YoBot Command Center Reorganization

This directory contains files to help reorganize the YoBot Command Center codebase for better maintainability and organization.

## Files

1. **REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed plan for the new file structure
2. **reorganize.py** - Python script to implement the reorganization

## How to Use

### Step 1: Review the Plan

First, review the reorganization plan in `REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` to understand the proposed changes.

### Step 2: Backup Your Code

Before proceeding, make sure to back up your code or commit all current changes to your version control system.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before reorganization"
```

### Step 3: Run the Reorganization Script

Run the reorganization script from the command line:

```bash
python reorganize.py
```

This script will:
- Create the new directory structure
- Copy files to their new locations
- Update import statements in Python files

### Step 4: Verify the Changes

After running the script, verify that everything works correctly:

1. Check that all files are in their expected locations
2. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
3. Start the application to make sure it runs properly

### Step 5: Clean Up

Once you've verified that everything works, you can delete the old files and directories that are no longer needed.

## Important Notes

- The reorganization script **copies** files rather than moving them, so your original files will still be in place until you delete them.
- You may need to manually update some import statements that the script couldn't automatically update.
- If you encounter any issues, you can revert to your backup or previous git commit.

## New Structure Benefits

The new structure provides several benefits:

1. **Logical Organization**: Files are grouped by feature/module rather than by file type
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Duplicate files are consolidated
3. **Consistent Naming**: Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
4. **Better Scalability**: Structure is designed to scale as the application grows
5. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find what they're looking for
