Use existing design system, exact spacing, gradient backgrounds, shadow styling

No dead buttons, broken modals, or missing fields

Do not guess or redesign any section — match screenshots exactly

Reference file naming must be consistent with App.tsx routing

🔁 FILES TO REVIEW / RESTORE FROM:
Use backup screenshots provided by Tyson (in /mnt/data/) showing the final approved layout — they are the correct source of truth.

✅ Once Done:
Confirm page routes are active

Confirm the full flow from platform select → config → results is working visually

Send Tyson screenshots of all five screens side by side for approval
