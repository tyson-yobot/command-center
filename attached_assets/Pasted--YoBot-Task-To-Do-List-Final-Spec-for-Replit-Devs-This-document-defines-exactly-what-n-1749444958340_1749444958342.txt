### 🎨 Command Center UI Cleanup: Color & Layout Improvements

The current button design is visually overwhelming. Button colors are scattered and overly saturated, making it look chaotic and unprofessional. This is hurting readability and usability.

#### ✅ New Button Style Guidelines (Effective Immediately)

* **Unify by function, not by randomness.** Use brand-consistent accent colors.

| Category                                 | Background       | Text/Border |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Primary Action (e.g. Launch, Sync, Save) | #007bff (blue)   | White       |
| Warning (Manual Follow-up, Escalation)   | #ffc107 (amber)  | Dark text   |
| Critical (Stop, Delete, Failures)        | #dc3545 (red)    | White       |
| Secondary/Utility (Export, View, PDF)    | #6c757d (gray)   | White       |
| Informational (Voice Input, Scrape)      | #6610f2 (violet) | White       |

* Use **rounded-lg** and **md\:text-sm** Tailwind classes for uniformity
* Add **hover\:brightness-110** and **transition duration-150 ease-in-out** for interaction polish
* Remove excessive emoji icons inside buttons — move icons to left side with consistent sizing
* Add a 2px border-radius inset shadow to match theme

#### Example React Button Component (Standardized)

```jsx
<Button className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg shadow hover:brightness-110 transition">
  <RocketIcon className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" /> Launch Sync
</Button>
```

### 🧩 Command Center Dashboard – Operational & UI Fixes

**Reviewed every section in the screenshots. Below are corrections and suggestions from an operations/design/marketing perspective:**

#### 🔧 Button Panel Fixes

* Buttons under `Core Automation`, `Voice & Communication`, and `Data & Reports` **look disconnected and redundant**.
* Eliminate repeated Content Creator / Mailchimp buttons entirely – they’re listed **3x each**.
* Group related functions in dropdowns or tab groups to **minimize clutter**.
* Replace the "Open" inactive buttons with tooltips explaining when they become active.

#### 📝 Verbiage & Layout Recommendations

* “Run Lead Scrape” → Rename to: **"Run Lead Scraper"** for consistency
* “Export Data” → Add dropdown for type: Deals, Contacts, Logs
* “Voice Input” button needs confirmation if it’s tied to live mic or chatbot field — unclear now
* “Start Pipeline Calls” and “Stop Pipeline Calls” should be stacked with a status chip above
* Move “Upload Documents” near the RAG section — it is not a Data Report action, it’s a Knowledge Upload action
* Add hover tooltips to every major call-to-action button

#### 📊 Widget Corrections

* `Voice Analytics` has no data. Gray it out or say "No calls yet".
* `Bot Health Monitor` & `Revenue Forecast` should be grouped under a shared “Performance Overview” section.
* `Smart Calendar` appears **twice**. Consolidate both into one card with toggle (e.g. “Today / Upcoming / Auto-Scheduled”)
* “System Status (Read-Only)” is redundant. Combine its metrics with the **Live Automation Engine** stats.

#### ✅ Suggestions to Add:

* Add a floating “🧼 Clear Test Data” button in Test Mode
* Add filter dropdown to Live Activity Feed (e.g. Filter by tag or user)
* Add visibility badges on card headers (e.g. “🟢 Live”, “🟡 Pending”, “🔴 Broken”)
