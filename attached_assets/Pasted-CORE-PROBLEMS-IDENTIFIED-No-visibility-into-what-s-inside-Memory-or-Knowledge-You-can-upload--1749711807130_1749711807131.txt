CORE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED
No visibility into what’s inside “Memory” or “Knowledge.”

You can upload, but you can't see or manage what’s stored.

No document-level preview or deletion.

Uploaded docs just sit there with no options to preview, edit, or remove.

"Memory" vs. "Knowledge" is confusing.

No visual feedback on where things go or how they behave differently.

No popups/modals for content management or audit trails.

You’re flying blind — can’t audit the knowledge base.

User flow is disconnected.

No guided steps for “Upload → View → Insert → Manage.”

✅ WHAT TO BUILD (REPLIT INSTRUCTIONS)
1. 🧠 Add a “View Knowledge Memory” Button
Right below “Memory Text Insertion” and next to “Upload Documents,” add:

Button: 🗂 View Knowledge Library

On click → open a modal window with:
A list view of all stored items (documents, manual text entries)

Display:

📝 Name

🕓 Date uploaded

🧠 Memory Type (Manual vs Document)

📦 Size

Action icons next to each item:

🔍 Preview

🗑 Delete

✏️ Edit Title

🪪 View Source Type (text/file)

2. 📖 Add "Preview Memory/Doc" Popup
When clicking 🔍 Preview:

Open a scrollable modal with:

Document name

Formatted text preview

Optional tags or linked memory category

Button: “Remove from Memory”

3. 🧾 Upload Documents Panel — Add Live Status + Options
Instead of just listing “YoBot Price List.docx,” show:

Filename	Status	Date Uploaded	Options
YoBot Price List.docx	✅ Indexed	Jun 12, 2025	🔍 Preview

Also add a visual spinner or green checkmark next to “Status” during upload → indexing.

4. ✅ Replace “Memory Inserted Successfully” Toast with Logs
Replace the tiny green toast with a section labeled:

🧠 Latest Memory Activity Log

Shows last 5 inserts with:

Timestamp

Type (Manual / File)

Category

Result (✅ Success / ❌ Error)

5. 🧰 Backend / Replit Notes:
Have your dev implement this as:

Store docs in a retrievable JSON or markdown format linked to their filename, with metadata (timestamp, source, type)

Link all memory entries to a table or memory_index.json file

On “View Knowledge Library” → Load JSON entries + document content from that index

All deletes/edit actions update both the visual UI and that stored JSON

✅ FINAL USER FLOW (RECOMMENDED)
User uploads file → sees live status + preview option

User inserts memory → it gets logged visibly with edit/delete control

User clicks “View Knowledge Library” → opens modal with all current memory entries

User can preview any item, rename, or delete

On hover, show full title + option to relabel

If user clears memory, show undo/confirm modal to prevent accidental wipe

Want me to mock up a layout or give this to you formatted as a Figma handoff or dev task card?

Just say the word — I’ll get it done fast.
