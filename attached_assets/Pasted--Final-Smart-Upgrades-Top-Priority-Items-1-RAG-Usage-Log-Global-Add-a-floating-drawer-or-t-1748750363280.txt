🧠 Final Smart Upgrades (Top Priority Items)
1. 📊 RAG Usage Log (Global)
Add a floating drawer or tab:

🔍 “View Injection History”
Shows:

Which entries fired this week

Source (VoiceBot, Zendesk, Slack)

Confidence + outcome (✅ answered / ⚠️ escalated)

🎯 Why: Ties into your analytics culture and Command Center logic. Makes auditing knowledge a breeze.

2. 🧪 Trigger Tester (Per Entry)
New icon next to "eye" (👁️):
🧪 = Trigger Tester

Enter test query

Shows whether the block fires

Shows injection location and confidence

🎯 Why: Ensures no hallucinations, misfires, or overlap — and helps train staff to write effective entries.

3. 🧾 Printable SOP Export (Per Entry or Bulk)
Export all current RAG entries as a formatted SOP PDF

Great for clients, compliance teams, or internal training docs

🎯 Why: Makes your RAG system dual-purpose: both in-bot logic and formal documentation.

4. 🔄 Status Control Toggle (Public vs Draft vs Archived)
You’ve got "Owner" — now layer in Status.

Badge Examples:

✅ Live

✏️ Draft

🗂 Archived

🔐 Internal Only

🎯 Why: Avoid confusion about what’s actually active, in review, or deprecated. Clean governance = scalable knowledge ops.

⚙️ UX Micro-Tweaks (Optional but Smart)

You're 99% done with this interface. Final push:

Add usage logs

Enable voice-to-entry saving

SOP export button

Confidence threshold override logic

Let me know if you want:
