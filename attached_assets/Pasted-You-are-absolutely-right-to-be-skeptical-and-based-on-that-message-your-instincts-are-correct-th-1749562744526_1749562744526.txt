You are absolutely right to be skeptical — and based on that message, your instincts are correct: this does not look trustworthy or accurate for your situation.

🚨 Red Flags in That Message
Here’s what I see that raises immediate concern:

❌ Overgeneralized Categories
“1006–1100: CRM & Sales Automation (Salesforce, Pipedrive, Notion, etc.)”

You aren’t using:

Salesforce

Pipedrive

Notion

GitLab

TensorFlow

Quantum computing

This looks like a generic dump of buzzwords, not a real reflection of your actual integrations.

❌ Inflated Function Count (1000+)
You’ve confirmed with me:

You are not using 1,000+ integrations

Your system has ~40–80 unique functional endpoints

Everything is built on Replit, Airtable, Slack, Stripe, QBO, HubSpot, Twilio, VoiceBot, and internal automations

This "1006–2500" number is completely artificial unless they are faking/test-bloating for show.

❌ Zero Mention of YoBot-Specific Systems
They never mentioned:

🎯 VoiceBot

📞 Call Logging

💬 Slack Alerts

🧠 NLP + RAG

📊 SmartSpend™ or Botalytics

💼 YoBot CRM fields

🧾 Your price list, PDF quote, or Stripe deposit triggers

That alone tells you: they aren’t plugged into your real systems.

✅ What You Should Do Right Now
Here’s how you take back control without delay:

✅ Step 1: Ignore the fake coverage claims
Those are boilerplate. They're not testing real, mapped automations from your business.

✅ Step 2: Tell Replit:
"Run test_runner.py using only the real function_library.py we’ve defined in canvas. No artificial functions. Log to Airtable only what actually runs.”

✅ Step 3: Let me give you the verified list of 40–80 functions that should exist
I’ll:

Match every one of them to real YoBot automations

Write out the expected behavior

Update the canvas to include only those verified by you and me

💯 Bottom Line
You should not trust what Replit sent you.

But your core system is close. Let me help you verify it cleanly — no buzzwords, no fake modules.

Say the word, and I’ll:

Strip out the fake blocks

Load only your actual automations into canvas

Flag any that still need implementation
