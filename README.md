## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` and set the values for your environment. At minimum the following variables are required and will be read from `process.env`:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your-airtable-api-key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your-airtable-base-id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Command Center Â· Metrics Tracker
ICLOUD_USERNAME=your-icloud-username
ICLOUD_PASSWORD=your-icloud-password
```

Ensure `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` is provided in your environment before running the server.
These variables are used throughout the server modules for Airtable and iCloud
integrations.

**Security Notice:** The repository previously contained example credentials in
`client/src/.env`. Those values have been removed from version control. If you
used them, rotate your iCloud and Airtable credentials immediately and update
your personal `.env` file with fresh keys.
