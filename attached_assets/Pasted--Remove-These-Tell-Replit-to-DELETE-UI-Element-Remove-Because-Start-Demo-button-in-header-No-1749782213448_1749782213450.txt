 Remove These (Tell Replit to DELETE):
UI Element	Remove Because…
Start Demo button (in header)	❌ Not needed — you’re not running self-guided demos
Demo Mode Active popups	❌ Adds unnecessary modal clutter, no value for screen recording
Any “Step 1 of X” walkthroughs	❌ Not part of your automation — you’re not using a tour framework
“Exit Demo” or “Finish Demo” flows	❌ No actual logic needed — demo ends when screen recording ends

✅ Button Instructions for Replit (Live/Functional)
Use these as the correct logic assignments for all buttons already in the UI:

🟢 Start Voice
Purpose: Begins voice command input (if mic is active)

Instruction to Replit:
Trigger the VoiceBot’s speech-to-text system and send result via webhook to Make.

Optional: Use button state toggle (active/inactive) and pulse animation when listening.

🎙️ Voice Input (in Voice & Communication)
Purpose: Allows voice-triggered actions (e.g. “Schedule follow-up”)

Instruction:
Opens voice modal or connects to browser mic input → triggers Make scenario.

🎧 Recordings
Purpose: Opens recent call transcripts or playback log

Instruction:
Open panel or page showing 📞 Voice Call Log Airtable table data.

⚡ Quick Ops
Purpose: Shortcuts for internal admin tasks

Instruction:
Dropdown with links to:

“Create Booking”

“Send SMS”

“Trigger Order Flow”
All should POST to your existing Make webhooks.

🧠 System
Purpose: Access live stats + uptime monitor

Instruction:
Open summary modal pulling from:

“Bot Status”

“System Health”

“Memory Active”
Optional: can fetch from Airtable or dummy JSON for now.

📤 Export
Purpose: Save a screenshot or PDF of the current dashboard

Instruction:
Export a PDF (via jsPDF or html2canvas) of current view.
Can also use static capture of div and auto-download.

🔁 Reset Demo
Purpose: Wipe test data so you can re-record a clean demo

Instruction:
Trigger a Make scenario that:

Clears test rows in Airtable (Voice Logs, Orders, etc.)

Resets session variables or UI states

Toasts: “Demo reset successfully!”

✅ Final Call to Action for Replit
"DELETE all demo buttons/popups/modals. None should remain."
Instead, make sure every operational button (Start Voice, Export, Quick Ops, etc.) is wired to:

A Make webhook

An Airtable record call

Or a UI function (modal, download, audio capture)
