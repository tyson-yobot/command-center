# 🧠 YoBot® Scraper Tool — Final Spec for Replit Devs

This document defines **exactly what needs to be done** for each lead scraper module (Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster) to ensure full functionality, perfect UX, cross-platform compatibility, and scalability for global deployment.

---

## ✅ Universal Requirements (Apply to All Tools)

* Group filters into logical sections
* Use consistent layout (2-column grid with left/right balance)
* All dropdowns must support default value + full label names
* Every input field should have a label and an optional tooltip ("?")
* Filters should be grouped into sections:

  * 🧑 Contact Filters
  * 🏢 Company/Business Filters
  * ⚙️ Scraping Settings
* Include bottom bar with:

  * 🔄 Filter summary (e.g. “7 filters applied”)
  * ⏱ Estimated leads (optional if backend can return estimate)
  * 💾 Save preset button
  * 🚀 Launch button (sticky footer on scroll)
* Toggle between **Test Company Mode** (fake data, instant) vs **YoBot Live Mode** (real scraper)
* UI color scheme should match the rest of the **YoBot® Command Center** (primary blue with tool-specific accents)
* ⚠️ Replace placeholder color boxes (black/purple/green backgrounds) with **Command Center-compliant dark navy base** with soft gradients

}
```

* Triggers real scraper pipeline
* Returns: `{ success: true, leadCount: 128, leads: [...] }`
