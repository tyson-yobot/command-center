Step 1: Confirm Webhook is Firing
Check your Replit webhook_handler.py file (or whichever receives the Tally data). Look for:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route("/sales-order", methods=["POST"])
def handle_sales_order():
    data = request.json
    print("Webhook received:", data)
    ...
DO THIS NOW:

Go to Replit Console or Logs tab.

Submit another Tally test.

Look for "Webhook received:" output.
→ If nothing appears, your webhook URL is incorrect or not connected in Tally.
→ If it does appear, continue to Step 2.

✅ Step 2: Confirm Folder Creation Logic
Somewhere in the webhook handler or a linked module, you should have logic like:

python
Copy
Edit
def create_client_folder(client_name):
    drive = GoogleDrive()  # should be authed
    folder_metadata = {
        'name': client_name,
        'mimeType': 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder',
        'parents': [CLIENTS_FOLDER_ID]
    }
    folder = drive.CreateFile(folder_metadata)
    folder.Upload()
    return folder['id']
Check for these issues:

✅ CLIENTS_FOLDER_ID is valid and not expired/missing.

✅ Google Drive is authenticated via drive = GoogleDrive() using proper credentials.

⚠️ Add a try/except block here to log errors if folder creation fails.

✅ Step 3: PDF Creation Check
Your script should either:

Call a Google Docs template → replace variables → export PDF
OR

Use a Python PDF library (like reportlab, fpdf, pdfkit) to generate it directly.

Make sure:

✅ File is created after folder ID is generated.

✅ PDF is uploaded back into that folder with:

python
Copy
Edit
file = drive.CreateFile({
    'title': 'Quote.pdf',
    'mimeType': 'application/pdf',
    'parents': [{'id': folder_id}]
})
file.SetContentFile("generated_quote.pdf")
file.Upload()
✅ Step 4: Email Sending
Final step should use your email logic (SMTP or SendGrid, etc):

python
Copy
Edit
send_email(to=email, subject="Your Quote", attachment=file.GetContent())
Common issues:

Missing recipient email (check Tally form parsing)

File not generated (so attachment is None)

Error in the sending library (SendGrid/SMTP/etc not authorized or failing silently)

Next 2 Fix Steps
🔧 1. Add Logging to All 3 Core Steps
In each stage of the pipeline (folder ➝ PDF ➝ email), add:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Step: Folder created ID:", folder_id)
print("Step: PDF generated at:", filepath)
print("Step: Email sent to:", recipient_email)
🧪 2. Rerun a Test Order from Tally
Submit a fresh test form and watch Replit logs. You’ll now see where it stops.

Once you’ve done those 2 steps, paste your log output here and I’ll pinpoint the fix instantly. Want me to drop a pre-built Replit script with logging and Google Drive auth fixes now?

Another thing I noticed was when I was scraping leads, I push them to hubspot no problem, but they are not logging into my airtable.


ChatGPT said:
Crystal clear. Here's what’s going on:

You're successfully scraping leads (via Apollo, Phantombuster, etc),
→ You’re pushing them to HubSpot correctly,
❌ But they aren’t hitting Airtable as expected.

🔎 Diagnosis: What’s Likely Happening
You’re using Replit as your integration hub — so your flow probably looks like this:

Scraper (Apollo/Phantom) → Replit Handler → HubSpot API = ✅
Scraper (same data) → Airtable API = ❌ — not executing, not receiving, or failing silently.

This usually comes down to one of 3 things:

✅ 1. Airtable API Key or Base ID is missing/wrong
Check your Airtable config file (or env variables). You should have:

python
Copy
Edit
AIRTABLE_API_KEY = "paty41tSgNrAPUQZV.7c0df078d76ad5bb4ad1f6be2adbf7e0dec16fd9073fbd51f7b64745953bddfa"
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = "appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if"
TABLE_ID = "tbldPRZ4nHbtj9opU"
Make sure:

The API key starts with pat, not the old key format.

The table ID is the actual internal Airtable table ID, not just the name.

✅ 2. The insert code is missing, commented out, or has a silent fail
You should have something like:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def push_to_airtable(record):
    url = f"https://api.airtable.com/v0/{AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/{TABLE_ID}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {AIRTABLE_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "fields": {
            "🧑 Full Name": record["name"],
            "📧 Email": record["email"],
            "📞 Phone": record.get("phone", ""),
            "🏢 Company": record.get("company", ""),
            "🔗 LinkedIn": record.get("linkedin_url", "")
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print("Airtable response:", response.status_code, response.text)
🔁 Submit a test and check logs:

If you see Airtable response: 200, it worked.

If you get 422 or 403, the format is wrong or key is bad.

If there’s no print at all, the function isn’t being called.

✅ 3. Field names mismatch or type errors
If you're sending to "Full Name" but Airtable has "🧑 Full Name", it fails.

Make sure the exact emoji-labeled field names are being used. Based on your setup, the standard fields in the CRM Contacts table should be:

🧑 Full Name

📧 Email

📞 Phone

🏢 Company

🔗 LinkedIn URL

📥 Lead Source (optional)

If your payload doesn’t match, Airtable silently drops it or gives a 422 error.

🧠 Fix This Now – 2 Step Action Plan
🛠 Step 1: Add Airtable Push Debug Block
Add this after your HubSpot success block:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Pushing to Airtable...")
push_to_airtable(record)
Make sure the record dict contains all necessary fields.

🔍 Step 2: Watch Replit Logs After Scraping a New Lead
You should now see:

text
Copy
Edit
Pushing to Airtable...
Airtable response: 200 {"id":"recXXXXXXX","fields":{...}}
