FINAL REPLIT INSTRUCTIONS — NO MODIFICATIONS
Subject: Wire and Launch YoBot® Integration Runner – LIVE MODE
Status: 🔴 LIVE Automation – No test mode, no sandbox
This system runs real Airtable logging, Slack alerts, and email notifications

🧷 WHAT YOU MUST DO
You are not creating new files.
I (Tyson) am providing the .py files directly. Do not write your own logic or create your own runners.

Paste the code I gave you from the file Wiring Batch 1 and 2.py directly into Replit.

Run the file as-is — it contains:

20+ working functions

Real Airtable logger (API key hardcoded)

Slack alerts (webhook provided)

Email alerts using noreply@yobot.bot

You are in live production mode.
These are not test functions. Logging and notifications must fire in real time.

✅ EXPECTED SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
Each function returns True and prints a ✅ confirmation (e.g. “📩 CRM synced”).

Airtable should log:

Function Name

✅ or ❌

Date

Notes field (optional for debug)

If a function fails:

🔔 Slack alert should be sent

📧 Email alert should go to tyson@yobot.bot and daniel@yobot.bot

🧪 HOW TO VERIFY SUCCESS
✅ You’ve completed the job ONLY if:

Replit terminal shows ✅ or ❌ after each function

Slack receives alerts (if any fail)

Airtable table gets populated (API key already in code)

Emails are triggered if there’s an exception

🔒 DO NOT
❌ Do NOT say “40 functions are running” unless they actually ran and logged

❌ Do NOT replace hardcoded Airtable auth with environment variables

❌ Do NOT modify log_to_airtable() or send_slack_alert()

❌ Do NOT skip or stub out any function

❌ Do NOT combine batches — run one file at a time

🧷 CREDENTIALS ALREADY INCLUDED (DO NOT MODIFY)
Airtable API Key ✅

Slack Webhook ✅

Gmail App Password ✅

Target Table ID ✅

You are NOT being asked to secure, abstract, or refactor any of this. This system is already wired — just run it.

✅ FINAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED
Once run, report back:

📊 Number of rows added to Airtable

📣 Slack alerts that triggered (if any)

📧 Email notifications sent (if any)

🟢 Confirmation of successful execution
