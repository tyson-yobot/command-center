🔧 Suggested Fixes & Improvements
1. Reorganize the Top Sections for Clarity
Current Issues:

Top row (Core Automation, Voice, Reports) feels crowded and equal-weighted — Voice features should be more prominent.

"Quick Actions" & toggle buttons are scattered in visual hierarchy.

Suggested Layout:

Top-Left: 🧠 AI Command Center (Voice + Automation Buttons)

Top-Center: 📞 Voice & Communication Cards (should dominate row)

Top-Right: 📊 Reports + Export/Calendar Sync Buttons

2. Move “Command Center Status” + Bot Metrics Higher
Why: These are central to uptime confidence and debugging. Currently buried in the lower middle.

Move up:

✅ YoBot® Health Monitor

⚙️ Live Automation Engine

🧠 AI Assistant Insights

3. Split Data Reporting vs Bot Performance
Current Issue: SmartSpend™, Botalytics™, Revenue Forecast, and Workflow cards are fragmented.

New Sections:

📈 Bot Business Performance

Revenue Forecast

Botalytics™

SmartSpend™

Conversation Analytics

📊 Bot System Health

Bot Health Monitor

Ops Metrics

Workflow Performance

Voice Analytics

4. Merge Duplicate Features / Unify Voice Tools
Current Duplicates / Spread Out:

"Voice Commands" and "Voice Command Center"

“Call Monitoring Panel” is disconnected from Voice/AI context

Solution: Create a unified "🎙️ Voice Engine Suite" that includes:

Voice Command Center

Voice Synthesis Studio

Voice Analytics

Voice Persona Settings

Call Monitoring

Conversation Analytics

Smart Calendar

5. RAG Section Optimization
Improvements:

RAG Knowledge Base should be collapsible or toggle-enabled.

Add AI suggestions under the “Ask the Knowledge Base” bar when typing (like autocomplete).

“Insert Memory” panel should clarify if user is feeding bot memory vs RAG ingestion.

6. Fix Typos / Labels
“Autotomate Your Business” → “Automate Your Business”

“Mobl Capp” → “Mobile App”

“Cets teads” → “Gets leads”

“100% 1000%yper day” → should say: “Calls 100–1,000+ per day”

➕ Features to Add
Section	Recommendation
📲 Mobile Companion Panel	Add iOS/Android device status, last app sync, and push alerts.
🧾 PDF & Export Panel	Show last generated PDF / export timestamp and quick access to recent exports.
📅 Smart Calendar	Add "Next 3 Tasks" view with time labels from the roadmap (if synced).
🛡️ Audit/Integrity Panel	Show last automation tamper flag, logger activity, fallback triggers.

🔄 Fix Panel Positioning
Move These to Bottom:

🧾 PDF Reports & Analytics

🧠 Memory Text Insertion

🎛️ Document Manager

Move These to Top-Mid:

📞 Live Automation Engine

🎯 Client Pulse

📊 Ops Metrics

🎙️ Voice Command Status (Listening state + last action)
