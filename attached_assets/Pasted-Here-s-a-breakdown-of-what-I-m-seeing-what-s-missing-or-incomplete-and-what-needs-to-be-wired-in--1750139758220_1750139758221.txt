Here’s a breakdown of what I’m seeing, what’s missing or incomplete, and what needs to be wired in, cleaned up, or finalized for go-live or demo.

✅ WHAT’S PRESENT + CORRECTLY STRUCTURED
1. SmartSpend™ & Botalytics™
✅ Metrics are present and styled correctly (Cost Per Lead, ROI, Payback Days, Interactions, Accuracy)

🟢 Suggestion: Add trend arrows or % change indicators (e.g. +12% this week) for clarity

2. PDF Reports & Analytics
✅ Card exists, properly labeled

❌ NOT WIRED: Reports Generated = 0, Success Rate = 0%

🛠️ Action: Needs POST /generate-pdf trigger and Airtable log of completed PDFs

🟢 Add: Last Generated timestamp field

3. Live Engine
✅ Status, Uptime, Processes showing

🟢 Suggestion: Link this directly to Live Pipeline (show count of queued jobs)

4. Core Automation + Sales Orders
✅ Buttons + process logic appear visually consistent

❌ Sales Order Process Orders button is likely not wired yet (recheck backend hook)

5. AI Automation Engine
✅ Labeled well

❌ Shows all zeroes — Needs wiring to real task execution count (via Airtable or Make migration to Replit if staying native)

6. System Audit Log / Escalation Alerts
✅ Clean structure

❌ Empty — needs backend data feed

✅ Should pull from: 📄 Slack Alerts, 📣 Escalation Tracker, 🛠️ Error Logs

7. Voice Programming Interface + Knowledge Base
✅ Tabs: Query Knowledge, Smart Search, Content Search, Upload Documents

❌ Buttons like Process Voice, Start Recording, Refresh Voices have no effect

🛠️ Action: Voice programming → RAG ingestion path must be finalized

✅ UI is polished but backend is not fully connected

8. Voice Synthesis Studio
✅ Voice generation + persona selection UI looks complete

❌ Buttons not triggering ElevenLabs API (no voice preview/playback active)

🟢 Suggestion: Add voice meter while generating

9. Memory Text Insertion + Knowledge Management
✅ Interface clean

❌ Buttons like “Insert into Memory” don’t show any response

✅ Latest Memory Activity Log placeholder is in place but empty

10. Document Manager
✅ Upload & Program Documents button is working visually

❌ “Test Only” tag implies backend not connected

🟢 Needs: Route to Airtable indexer or your document parsing module

11. Call Monitoring Panel
✅ Simulation button, metrics (Calls, Duration, Success), and service controls (Start, Reset, Ping)

❌ Backend likely missing: simulate test call has no visual result

🟢 Suggestion: Add a blinking meter or animation during active monitoring

12. YoBot Support
✅ Ticket interface styled well

❌ Likely not connected to live support system

🟢 Needs: Airtable Support Ticket Summary table sync or external Zendesk integration

🔁 CONSISTENCY FIXES
Issue	Fix
SmartSpend / Botalytics tile order flips between views	Lock SmartSpend to right of Botalytics
“Reports Generated” stuck at 0	Needs PDF Generator → Airtable Logging
Blank sections (Audit, Escalation, Memory)	Add simulated or seeded data if needed for demo
Voice Synthesis buttons inactive	Hook to ElevenLabs API or mock endpoint
Export Dashboard still broken	Replace local explorer call with modal selection and proper file download routing
