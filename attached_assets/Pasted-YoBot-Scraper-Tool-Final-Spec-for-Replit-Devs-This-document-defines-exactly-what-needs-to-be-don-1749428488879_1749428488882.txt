YoBot® Scraper Tool — Final Spec for Replit Devs

This document defines exactly what needs to be done for each lead scraper module (Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster) to ensure full functionality, perfect UX, cross-platform compatibility, and scalability for global deployment.

✅ Universal Requirements (Apply to All Tools)

Group filters into logical sections

Use consistent layout (2-column grid with left/right balance)

All dropdowns must support default value + full label names

Every input field should have a label and an optional tooltip ("?")

Filters should be grouped into sections:

🧑 Contact Filters
️- 🏢 Company/Business Filters

⚙️ Scraping Settings

Include bottom bar with:

🔄 Filter summary (e.g. “7 filters applied”)

⏱ Estimated leads (optional if backend can return estimate)

💾 Save preset button

🚀 Launch button (sticky footer on scroll)

After ANY scraper or automation test is run (real or simulated), a record must be inserted into the Airtable Integration Test Log table:

POST https://api.airtable.com/v0/appRt8V3tH4g5Z5if/Integration%20Test%20Log
Authorization: Bearer {AIRTABLE_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

✨ UI Enhancements (All Tools)

Use consistent spacing and padding (p-4 or p-6 Tailwind standard)

Tool-specific color themes:

Apollo = Blue

Apify = Green

PhantomBuster = Purple

Sticky Launch Button: Always visible on scroll

Dark mode toggle optional but consistent with rest of Command Center

Responsive: Must work flawlessly on desktop and tablet (mobile optional for now)

✅ When "Run Lead Scraper" is Clicked:

Show the 3-option platform selector (Apollo, Apify, Phantom)

When a tool is selected, load the proper panel directly below the selector

All configuration fields must appear dynamically

Launch button sends JSON payload to /api/launch-scrape endpoint with { tool: "apollo", filters: { ... } }

After success, show a toast alert or modal: ✅ 248 leads scraped. View in Airtable »

✅ Automatically log the result into Airtable Integration Test Log table with timestamp

🔧 Developer Notes

Reuse same component template for all 3 tools with dynamic props for fields

All state should be cached per tool (user switching between tools shouldn’t wipe filters)

Preset storage can be simple localStorage for now, but backend support coming soon

If API fails to estimate or launch, show graceful error message in toast
