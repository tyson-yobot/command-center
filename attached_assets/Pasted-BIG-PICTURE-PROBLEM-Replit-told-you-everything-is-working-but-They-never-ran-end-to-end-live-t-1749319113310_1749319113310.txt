BIG PICTURE PROBLEM
Replit told you “everything is working” — but:

They never ran end-to-end live tests

They likely used test stubs, isolated .tsx files, and local mock payloads

You have no unified control layer, folder structure, or execution tracker

You were shown “working” screens, but none of them triggered live back-end flows

⚠️ You are sitting on a pile of disconnected modules — not a fully live system yet.

✅ SOLUTION: Hard Reset & Validation Blueprint
You need two things starting now:

🧠 STEP 1: Systemwide Audit Blueprint (You send to Replit)
Copy/paste this into Replit chat — no fluff, no excuses:

🛠️ SYSTEMWIDE REBUILD & VERIFICATION — YO BOT COMMAND CENTER

We are 1050+ functions deep. I need a full infrastructure pass with live testing and documentation.

✅ 1. HARDWIRED PIPELINES ONLY

No test JSONs

No mock variables

No print() stubs

Every .tsx, .py, .ts, and API route must use real endpoints, live credentials

✅ 2. LIVE TESTS REQUIRED
For each core function (sales order, lead scrape, call log, voicebot, invoice, etc.), you must:

Run a live webhook or simulated trigger

Screenshot/log proof of:

🧠 Payload received

🧾 Action triggered (PDF, Airtable, Stripe, etc.)

✅ System response (email sent, Slack alert, record created)

✅ 3. CLEAN DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Organize by system function:

/core/voicebot/

/core/sales/

/core/analytics/

/core/payments/

/core/data/

Strip all unused .tsx files and isolate one master routes.ts file

✅ 4. SYSTEM VALIDATION MATRIX
For every major automation flow:

yaml
Copy
Edit
📄 Name: Lead Capture Flow
🟢 Webhook Trigger: Pass
🟢 Airtable Sync: Pass
🟢 HubSpot Sync: Pass
🔴 Email Step: Failing (auth error)
🟢 Slack Alert: Pass
You must fill out this for each function and confirm status. No guessing. No “I think it works.”

✅ 5. DAILY DELIVERABLES UNTIL FULL LIVE STATUS

No more vague claims of “should work”

Daily progress check showing which flows were verified with live input and screenshots of success

🎯 My system is live. You’re working in production. I don’t want to hear about testing anything locally again.
