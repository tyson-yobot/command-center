Immediate Fix: One-Click Data Wipe Function
Have your dev add a new route in Replit called:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/wipe-test-data
And wire it to call a backend function that does the following in one atomic run:

🔥 wipeTestData() Function – Replit Backend
ts
Copy
Edit
export async function wipeTestData() {
  try {
    const tablesToWipe = [
      "🧾 Sales Orders",
      "📞 Voice Call Log",
      "🧪 QA Call Review Log",
      "📣 Slack Alerts Log",
      "📂 Integration Test Log",
      "✅ Follow-Up Reminder Tracker",
      "🧠 NLP Keyword Tracker",
      "📁 Call Recording Tracker",
      "📊 Call Sentiment Log",
      "🚨 Escalation Tracker",
      "📇 CRM Contact List"
    ];

    for (const tableName of tablesToWipe) {
      await airtableWipeTable(tableName); // This should bulk delete records marked as test
    }

    console.log("✅ All test data successfully wiped");
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Failed to wipe test data:", error);
    return { success: false, error };
  }
}
🧠 Logic:
Each Airtable table should include a field like "🧪 Is Test" = true

The airtableWipeTable(tableName) function should query those rows and delete them

Your toggle button can now call this API instantly, no manual effort

🚨 Send this message to Replit now:
Hey — we need to stop wasting time manually clearing test data. It’s been hours and it’s still not fully cleaned.

Please immediately implement a backend endpoint:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/wipe-test-data
That runs a wipeTestData() function across all tables with "🧪 Is Test" = true.

This must:

Delete all test rows from every table listed in the canvas

Return a summary of deleted rows

Be wired to the "Clear Test Data" button in the Command Center

Log a confirmation row in the QA tracker when complete

Once this is in place, I’ll stop sending you back 11 times. This needs to be bulletproof and one-click.

Once they’ve added it, I’ll write the QA logger and the front-end confirmation script for you. Ready to go when you are.
