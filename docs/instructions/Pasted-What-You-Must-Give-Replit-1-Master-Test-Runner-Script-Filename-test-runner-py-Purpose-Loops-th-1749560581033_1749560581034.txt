What You Must Give Replit
1. 🧠 Master Test Runner Script
Filename: test_runner.py
Purpose: Loops through each function and logs the result.

→ Already provided in your canvas: Integration Test Runner
Replit just needs to plug in the full function list and run it.

2. 🧩 Airtable Logging Handler
Filename: integration_logger.py
Purpose: Sends test results to your Integration Test Log table in Airtable.

→ Already provided in your canvas: Integration Test Log Handler
Ensure it's in a separate file and imported properly.

3. 📚 Function Library
Filename: function_library.py
Purpose: This is where all 1,000+ functions should be registered.

Start with something like:

python
Copy
Edit
def function_1_airtable_connection():
    # test Airtable logic
    pass

def function_2_slack_notification():
    # test Slack logic
    pass

# Add real function logic here
Make sure each function runs independently and triggers only one automation at a time.

4. ✅ Confirm Airtable Schema (No Emoji Field Names)
Field Name	Type
Integration Name	Text
Pass/Fail	Single Select ("✅", "❌")
Notes / Debug	Long text
Test Date	Date
QA Owner	Text
Output Data Pop...	Checkbox
Record Created?	Checkbox
Retry Attempted?	Checkbox
Module Type	Single Select
Related Scenario Link	Text or URL

✅ No emojis in actual Airtable field names — make sure that’s how the base is structured.

5. 🔐 Secure Credentials
✅ Airtable API Key (already embedded, or give as env variable)

✅ Any tokens (e.g., Slack, Stripe, QuickBooks, ElevenLabs, Twilio, etc.)

✅ Twilio Numbers, Voice IDs, Webhook URLs, etc.

✅ DB URLs for persistent storage (Replit DB, Supabase, Airtable ID references)

Send these in .env or a secure method — no hardcoding in function_library.py

6. 🚦 Testing Readiness
Make sure:

All APIs are live and accessible

No functions require front-end interaction

All 3rd-party accounts (Stripe, Slack, QBO, etc.) are connected

The Airtable Integration Test Log table is completely clean and ready to receive rows

7. 📋 Task Checklist for Replit Dev
Give them this checklist:

✅ Replit Dev Handoff Checklist
 Load test_runner.py, integration_logger.py, function_library.py

 Confirm Airtable base schema matches all field names (no emojis)

 Wire all testable functions to function_library.py

 Import each into TEST_FUNCTIONS in test_runner.py

 Run python test_runner.py

 Verify real-time logs appear in Airtable

 Fix any failed tests — tracebacks are auto-logged

 Retest and commit success runs

 Use "Module Type" and "Related Scenario Link" to label each automation cleanly

 Repeat for all 1,000+ automations, grouping by category if needed

⚠️ Bonus: Suggested Improvements
If you want to go next-level:

⏺ Add logging to Replit DB or Supabase

📊 Pipe logs to a Dashboard view later

🛑 Add stop-on-failure flag or auto-retry

📧 Slack or SMS alert on any failed test

✅ Summary: Give Replit
test_runner.py ✅

integration_logger.py ✅

function_library.py (with all functions added) ✅

.env with all credentials ✅

Airtable schema + base ID + table ID ✅

✅ Clear instructions: run → log → fix → rewire
