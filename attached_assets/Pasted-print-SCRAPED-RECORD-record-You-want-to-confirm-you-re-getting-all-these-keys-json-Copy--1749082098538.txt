print("SCRAPED RECORD:", record)
You want to confirm you‚Äôre getting all these keys:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@company.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4567",
  "company": "Company Inc.",
  "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
}
If email/phone are missing here ‚Äî the scraper didn‚Äôt capture them
‚Üí Let me know which tool you used (Apollo, Phantom, etc.) and I‚Äôll adjust the parser.

2. ‚úÖ Check the HubSpot Push Function
Make sure you‚Äôre calling something like this:

python
Copy
Edit
def push_to_hubspot(record):
    url = "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {HUBSPOT_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    data = {
        "properties": {
            "firstname": record.get("name", "").split()[0],
            "lastname": record.get("name", "").split()[-1],
            "email": record.get("email", ""),
            "phone": record.get("phone", ""),
            "company": record.get("company", "")
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    print("HubSpot response:", response.status_code, response.text)
‚ö†Ô∏è If you don‚Äôt include "email" and "phone", HubSpot accepts the contact but stores only what you gave it ‚Äî which is why you‚Äôre seeing empty fields.

üõ† Next Step: Patch Before You Rerun
Let me know if you want me to:

Drop the correct push_to_hubspot.py module,

Or scan one of your scraped payloads to fix the parsing layer before it hits either API.

That way, both Airtable and HubSpot get clean, complete records every time.







You said:

And a lot of empty ones I see...

ChatGPT said:
That screenshot confirms it ‚Äî you‚Äôre getting a bunch of ghost contacts in HubSpot: empty rows, no email, no phone, no owner. This happens when:

‚ùå HubSpot accepts partial or empty contact objects
HubSpot will create a contact even if all you send is this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "properties": {
    "firstname": "‚Äî"
  }
}
So if your scraper gives you None for email and phone, or your push function skips them entirely, HubSpot still stores the contact ‚Äî just blank.

üîß Fix This Now in 2 Steps
‚úÖ Step 1: Check Your Record Before Push
In your scraper or parser script, print the full record object like this:

python
Copy
Edit
print("SCRAPER RECORD:", json.dumps(record, indent=2))
You want to confirm that this is the structure before pushing to HubSpot:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@company.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4567",
  "company": "Acme Inc.",
  "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
