 1. Styling Tips for Manual Call Screen
The Manual Call Start modal is clean, but a few refinements will elevate the professionalism and usability:

🔹 Layout & Contrast
Background Transparency: Add slight blur (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) and reduce opacity to ~95%. It'll make the modal float better above your vibrant Command Center backdrop.

Field Borders: Use a subtle border (1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)) with rounded corners (border-radius: 6px) for each input to make them pop and look more modern.

Padding: Add consistent internal padding inside each input block — right now the spacing looks tight.

🔹 Typography
Label font weight: Increase font-weight of labels slightly (font-weight: 500–600) so they don’t blend into the field background.

Field font size: Slightly increase font size of input text for readability (16px ideal).

🔹 Visual Hierarchy
Section grouping: Group related fields visually:

📞 Contact Info: Phone, Name, Email, Company.

🗣️ Call Details: Type, Voice Profile, Priority, Script.

📝 Notes: Additional Notes.

Add faint dividers or vertical spacing between these groups.

🔹 Call to Action (CTA)
"Create Call" Button:

Make it bolder with slight drop shadow.

Optional: Animate on hover for feedback (e.g., slight scale up).

🧠 2. Naming Convention for Popup Screens
The "Manual Call Start" window and similar ones (like Lead Scraper, Submit Ticket, etc.) are best described as:

✅ Modal Workflows or Overlay Panels
Other viable naming options depending on usage:

Quick Action Modals (good match for your "Quick Action Launchpad")

Pop-Up Forms

Task Panels (if used in process chains)

Action Screens (clean generic label for non-forms)

Suggested standard:

Modal Naming Format = “Action · Module”
Example: Manual Call · Voice Ops, Lead Scraper · Contact Pipeline, etc.

🧪 3. Command Center Feedback (What to Fix, Add, Remove)
🟢 What’s Working Great:
Strong color-coding by category (Green = Ops, Orange = Analytics, Purple = Comms).

Clear “System Mode” status indicators.

Dashboard View toggles are smart for ops visibility.

Section names like “Voice Engine,” “Audit & Integrity,” and “SmartSpend™” are clean.

⚠️ Suggested Fixes & Enhancements
1. Add Hover Tooltips for Each Block
Each block (e.g., “Submit Ticket”, “Lead Scraper”) needs a tooltip or quick hover help that explains:

“Submit Ticket → Opens an internal issue form to escalate or log a support task to tech team.”

2. Combine Redundant Call to Action Buttons
You have "Start Pipeline" twice — once in “Quick Action Launchpad” and again in “Voice Engine + Command Center.”
✅ Recommendation: Keep one in the top section, and make the second one a status-only indicator or remove it.

3. Status Panels: Too Many Zeros = Dead Feel
Client Pulse / Ops Stats / AI Assistant Insights are all zeros.

Add placeholders or mock/test values until full data is flowing.

Example: “AI Accuracy: (Coming soon - training in progress)” instead of hard zero.

4. RAG Panel – Separate UI for Search vs Programming
Split this into tabs:

Tab 1: Search Knowledge

Tab 2: Voice Program Commands

Tab 3: Upload Sources
It feels crowded vertically. A tabbed interface will reduce scroll fatigue.

5. Missing Branding Anchors
You need:

Mini logo favicon pinned in the Command Center title bar.

Company name (YoBot® Inc.) and user greeting (e.g. “👋 Welcome, Tyson”) in top-right.

📌 Next Step
Do This Now:

Add a new style class for modal-panel that:

Adds blur, rounded corners, padding

Divides sections into blocks

Rename internal modal templates like:

ManualCallModal

LeadScraperModal

TicketSubmissionModal
So you can reuse base components in React/V
