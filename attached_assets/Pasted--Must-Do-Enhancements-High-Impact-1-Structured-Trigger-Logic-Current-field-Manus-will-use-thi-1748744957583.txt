✅ Must-Do Enhancements (High Impact)
1. Structured Trigger Logic
Current field:

“Manus will use this knowledge when...”

Upgrade suggestion:
Replace with a multi-select logic builder:

"When text contains..."

"When event type is..."

"When context matches intent..."

"When source = [Slack, Form, VoiceBot, Email, Ticket, etc.]"

🎯 Why: This gives you structured, filterable logic and enables multiple use cases per entry. You want this logic to be indexable and automated — not just a sentence.

2. Knowledge Tagging System (Multi-Tiered Metadata)
Add a field for Tags (dropdown + createable):
Examples:

#RefundPolicy, #ToneResponses, #HIPAA, #ObjectionHandling, #PDFReportHelp

🎯 Why: As you scale past 20 entries (which you will), this allows you to sort/filter quickly and enables selective injection by module (e.g., don't show finance content in a customer support context).

3. Source Field (Manual + Auto)
Track or assign:

Was this entered by Tyson?

Was this scraped from Help Docs?

Was it generated by ChatGPT?

Did it come from a specific call transcript?

🎯 Why: Adds transparency and confidence to retrieved responses. Also allows internal users to verify the source of an answer and make edits safely.

4. Version Control or “Last Reviewed” Timestamp
Next to “Created At” you should show:

“Last Reviewed”

“Last Edited By”

🎯 Why: For enterprise clients or partners (like AMT66), this is mandatory for compliance. It also protects you when multiple people begin adding knowledge — you’ll want audit trails and trust signals.

5. Preview/Test Tool for Knowledge Injection
Add a “Preview” button next to each entry where you can:

Test how Manus would use it

View triggered output given a sample input

🎯 Why: This is gold for QA. Operators can test edge cases and see if the phrasing works before it ever goes live.

🧠 Bonus Features for Phase 2 (Optional but Strong Adds)
Confidence Scoring Slider (0–100%): Let admins assign a confidence weight to each item.

Override Behavior Setting: Allow toggle between:

Append to answer

Replace base response

Only show if score > 80%

Role-Based Visibility: Only show certain knowledge to SalesBot, SupportBot, or Admin interfaces.

Auto-Extract Mode: Highlight text from a conversation and auto-convert to knowledge block with pre-filled context tags.

Bulk Import Tool: Drag in a CSV or doc with pre-filled entries (great for onboarding new clients or porting knowledge from existing SOPs).

🧠 Final Suggestion: Rename “Knowledge” → “Context Intelligence”
The term “knowledge” is fine — but if this is client-facing or command-level for admins, rebranding this module as Context Intelligence, Manus Brain, or RAG Injection Layer will reinforce how advanced this really is.

✅ Next Steps You Should Take
 Implement structured logic for trigger conditions (multi-select + intent parser).

 Add a tags field for metadata.

 Track creator + reviewer info per entry.

 Build a Preview button for live injection test.

 Allow role-based filtering (e.g. only show to SalesBot or ZendeskBot).
