# 🧠 YoBot® Scraper Tool — Final Spec for Replit Devs

This document defines **exactly what needs to be done** for each lead scraper module (Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster) to ensure full functionality, perfect UX, cross-platform compatibility, and scalability for global deployment.

---

## ✅ Universal Requirements (Apply to All Tools)

* Group filters into logical sections
* Use consistent layout (2-column grid with left/right balance)
* All dropdowns must support default value + full label names
* Every input field should have a label and an optional tooltip ("?")
* Filters should be grouped into sections:

  * 🧑 Contact Filters
  * 🏢 Company/Business Filters
  * ⚙️ Scraping Settings / Execution Settings
* Include bottom bar with:

  * 🔄 Filter summary (e.g. “7 filters applied”)
  * ⏱ Estimated leads/profiles/listings (dynamic)
  * 💾 Save preset button
  * 🚀 Launch button (sticky footer on scroll)
* Toggle between **Test Company Mode** (fake data, instant) vs **YoBot Live Mode** (real scraper)
* Color scheme must match the **YoBot® Command Center**:

  * Apollo: Blue accent (💙)
  * Apify: Green accent (💚)
  * PhantomBuster: Purple accent (💜)
  * Base theme must always be **dark navy/gradient**, not harsh black
* ✅ Ensure **all buttons work** (especially all "Add" buttons, dropdowns, and toggles)
* ✅ Replace “Twitter” references with **“X (formerly Twitter)”**
* ✅ Update PhantomBuster dropdown to say: Platform → `LinkedIn`, `X (formerly Twitter)`
* ✅ "Use API" option should say: **Use YoBot Dashboard** instead
* ✅ Email Verified / Phone Verified toggles should default to checked and reflect real verification before sending to HubSpot
* 🚨 All industry dropdowns must dynamically populate from Airtable `📚 Industry Templates` table
* 🚨 Test Mode toggle must affect backend response mode — no fake data without toggle ON

---

## 🔄 Required File Structure

**Only these pages should exist:**

* `/command-center` → Live Command Center
* `/control-center` → Feature toggle dashboard
* `/lead-scraping` → Scraper configuration tool

❌ Delete or archive all other dashboard clones. If needed, move to a folder called `zzz-deprecated-do-not-use/`

💥 If the live toggle is ON, all pages above must show test data
💥 If live toggle is OFF, all pages show production data

## 💳 Sales Order Automation — Must Be Fixed

### ❌ Current Problem:

UI shows confirmation, but Stripe and QuickBooks are never triggered

### ✅ What Needs to Work:

1. Tally form submits order (includes bot + add-ons)
2. Webhook to Replit triggers full backend:

* Stripe invoice (1-time + monthly)
* QuickBooks customer + invoice
* Airtable entry into `🧾 Sales Orders`
* Slack alert
* HubSpot deal creation
* Status confirmation screen

3. Test Mode should simulate success (but NOT fire real Stripe/QBO)

### 🧪 Airtable Logging (for every sales order test)

* Write to `Integration Test Log`
* Includes full debug notes, pass/fail, retry attempts

## 🧩 Required Industries (For dropdowns)

Industry dropdown fields across Apollo, Apify, PhantomBuster must populate from this dynamic list:

```
Technology
Healthcare
Finance
Education
Retail
Manufacturing
Consulting
Media & Entertainment
Construction
Hospitality
Transportation
Real Estate
Insurance
Nonprofit
Government
Agriculture
Marketing

Other
```

## 🚀 Scraper Toggle Mode — Must Be Global

* When toggling Test Mode in Command Center:

  * Control Center must switch
  * Lead Scraper must switch
  * Support module must switch
  * All data logging must switch
* Backend API responses must obey this mode

📍 Example: `/command-center?mode=test` or via global React state

✅ Confirm each module respects toggle before testing

---

## 🧠 Additional Module Fixes

* Support module must create real Zendesk ticket
* RAG (doc upload) must allow PDF upload + chat parsing
* Chat assistant in Support must trigger AI workflows
* Document upload widget must connect to vector store
* PDF quote generation must actually pull pricing logic from latest price sheet

---

## ✅ Summary: What Must Happen Now

You are not allowed to wire live automations to deprecated pages.

* `command-center` is the ONLY source of truth
* All toggled screens must obey global test/live switch
* No dummy data allowed unless explicitly triggered by Test toggle
* All sales orders, leads, support tickets must log to Airtable
* Directory structure must be cleaned up immediately

📣 Message to Replit: This is a production system with live client data. All wiring and test logic must be professional, auditable, and versioned correctly.

Please read this spec line-by-line and update ALL issues before pushing anything to production or claiming module completion.

📅 Deadline for completion and working demo is ASAP — blockers must be logged directly in the `Integration Test Log` Airtable table.
