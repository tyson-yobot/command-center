PRIORITY FIXES YOU CAN PUSH TODAY
1. 🔍 Audit What's Real vs. Dummy in Command Center
Have Replit run this exact Python function in Replit or backend to scan for any dummy/test values in your live database/API payloads:

python
Copy
Edit
def find_test_data(records: list):
    suspicious_terms = ["test", "sample", "lorem", "demo", "john doe", "placeholder", "dummy", "asdf"]
    flagged = []
    for record in records:
        for key, value in record.items():
            if isinstance(value, str) and any(term in value.lower() for term in suspicious_terms):
                flagged.append((record.get("id", "NO_ID"), key, value))
    return flagged
👉 Tell them:
"Run this on all displayed records in SmartSpend™, Botalytics™, Voice Input logs, and System Status. Send me the flagged items."

2. ⚙️ Voice Command → Scrape Trigger (Live Today)
You want wins? Let’s wire this now.

🔗 Endpoint:
POST /voice-command

🎯 Trigger Phrase:
“Scrape leads for chiropractors in Dallas from Apollo”

✅ Action Flow:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "tool": "apollo",
  "filters": {
    "industry": "Chiropractic",
    "location": "Dallas",
    "title": "Owner",
    "size": "1–10",
    "email_verified": true
  }
}
💥 Output Route: Save leads to Airtable → HubSpot → Send Slack Alert

You now have:

Real command input

Parsed intent

Fields that can pass to your scraper function

A full voice → scrape flow without UI friction

3. 🧠 Scraper Logs Tracker Table (Airtable)
Import this now to track what’s real:

🔢 Scrape ID	📅 Date	🧰 Tool	🎯 Filters Used	🔄 Status	📥 Records Pulled	✅ Saved To
#1003	6/8/25	Apollo	Chiropractors, Dallas	✅ Completed	84	Airtable, HubSpot
#1004	6/8/25	Apify	Plumbers, Phoenix	🔄 In Progress	–	–

→ Use this to kill the guessing
→ Hook each scraper to log directly here
→ Use this table to drive a real “Scrape History” dashboard block

🔥 NEXT STEPS (No Waiting)
✅ Give me the names of any current test entries you want wiped or flagged.

✅ I’ll hand you a full Replit-side logging handler and a working scrape-launch webhook.

✅ We make that “Run Scraper” button actually launch something real, no more eye candy.
