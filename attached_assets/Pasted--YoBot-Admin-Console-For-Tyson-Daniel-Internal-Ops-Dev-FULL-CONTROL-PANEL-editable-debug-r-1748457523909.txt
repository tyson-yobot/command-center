Edit
// Pseudocode for access control
if (user.role === 'admin') {
   loadAllModules(); // Full control
} else if (user.role === 'client') {
   load([
      'botStatusPanel',
      'roiTracker',
      'conversionFunnel',
      'activityFeed',
      'smartCalendar',
      'billingSummary',
      'botalyticsLite',
      'supportCenter'
   ]);
}
🛠️ Action Steps You Should Take Now
Tag All Current Modules with adminOnly, clientVisible, or sharedReadOnly

Split Routes in Replit:

/admin → Loads everything

/dashboard → Loads only approved client modules

Hide Buttons for Clients even on read-only modules — no toggles, voice uploads, or system links.

Future-proof Suggestion: Add a toggleable Demo Mode view so sales reps can walk a client through without logging into a real environment.
