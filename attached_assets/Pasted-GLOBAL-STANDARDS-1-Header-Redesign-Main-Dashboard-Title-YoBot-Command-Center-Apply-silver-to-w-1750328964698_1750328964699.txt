GLOBAL STANDARDS
1. Header Redesign
Main Dashboard Title (YoBot¬Æ Command Center):

Apply silver-to-white gradient background.

Text should be #000000 (Black), bold, large, and centered.

Include the YoBot¬Æ icon on the left.

Top bar (currently Royal Blue):

Replace with darker gradient (e.g., #0d82da to #000000) or a matte YoBot¬Æ Navy.

Navigation icons should glow subtly on hover.

üß© CARD & LAYOUT RULES
2. All Cards
Minimum of 2 cards per row, ideally 3.

NEVER allow a single card to span full width alone.

Add 24px padding around every card.

Outer border = THICK electric blue neon.

Inside elements = subtle silver inner glow (for charts, text blocks, or sections).

3. Interactive Cards (with buttons)
These must be grouped TOGETHER at the top.

All button-based cards (manual calls, ticket submission, PDF upload, scraper, diagnostics, etc.) must be:

Under the Quick Action Launchpad and above all analytics.

Grouped consistently ‚Äî do not scatter them across the dashboard.

üß≤ BUTTON STYLE MANDATE
4. All Buttons (Primary, Action, Navigation)
Uniform style across the entire system.

Use neon border + soft glow/shadow.

Color logic:

‚úÖ Success/confirm: Electric Blue with white glow

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Orange

‚ùå Critical/Emergency: Red with glow

üìÑ Secondary/actions: Silver with glow on hover

Text inside buttons must be readable: white or black depending on contrast.

üìä ANALYTICS LAYOUT
5. Analytics & Metrics Cards
All analytics and reporting blocks should appear in clean rows at the bottom.

Use consistent layout:

One row: SmartSpend‚Ñ¢

One row: Botalytics‚Ñ¢

One row: AI Assistant Insights + Ops Stats + Client Pulse

Last row: System Health

Keep metrics stacked in 2‚Äì3 cards per row ‚Äî don‚Äôt stack 6 long blocks vertically.
