🔧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED / ADDED
1. ❌ PROBLEM: All Services Show "Inactive" With No Way to Start Them
✅ SOLUTION: Add manual control toggles or status refreshers

Add Start / Restart / Ping Test buttons beside each:

Monitoring Service: [ Start ⏵ | Restart 🔁 | Status 🔍 ]

Show last ping time and health response

Add tooltip on hover: “This service is responsible for real-time monitoring of bot calls. If inactive, live sessions will not be tracked.”

2. ❌ PROBLEM: No Session or Call Report Triggers
✅ SOLUTION: Add “Simulate Test Call” or “Force Session In”

Add a dev-only button: 📞 Simulate Test Call

Generates fake call data for testing call reports and session tracking

Lets you verify call analytics and log ingestion

3. ❌ PROBLEM: “No Call Reports” = Empty Forever
✅ SOLUTION: Add sample call data or import option

Add: 📁 Upload Call Logs or 🧪 Generate Dummy Reports

Preview columns:

🕓 Timestamp

🧠 Bot Name

🎯 Intent Triggered

😠 Sentiment Score

🔍 Transcript Preview

Each row should have: ▶️ View | 📤 Export | 🗑 Delete

4. ❌ PROBLEM: No Status Dashboard Feedback
✅ SOLUTION: Add colored indicators + real-time refresh

Add:

🟢 "Active" when any call connects

🟡 "Idle" when system is running but unused

🔴 "Offline" with reason (e.g., Lambda not responding, API key missing)

Add ↻ Refresh Status button at top right of panel

5. ❌ PROBLEM: No Log History or Debugging
✅ SOLUTION: Add Logs Panel

Section: 📜 Call Log History

Shows:

Call ID

Bot name

Duration

Fail/Success tag

Link to voice/audio

Show real-time updates as calls happen
